The lodgment security code number was also\\nrevealed to me, he then advised me to look for a\\nreliable business partner abroad, that will assist me\\nin investing the money in a lucrative business as a\\nresult of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is\\nthe main reason why I am contacting you for us to move\\nthis money from the security firm to any Country of\\nyour choice for investment purpose. \\n\\nSo I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so\\nthat the funds can be moved in your name and\\nparticulars to any Country of your choice where it\\nwill be claimed and invested.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. \\nI have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. \\nThis money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband\\'s properties is under the authority of the family\\'s lawyer Tony Musa. \\n \\nMy Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband\\'s wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \"Personal will\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!\\nurther advise,! no relations or fr! \\niends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. \\nThe situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \"SOS\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. \\nI hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. \\nThe documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. \\nPlease, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. \\nPlease all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. \\nI look forward to your quick response. \\nBest Wishes, \\nMrs. Maryam Abacha \\n \\n\\n\\n',\n",

This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign\\npartner. This request may seem strange and\\nunsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed\\nmemory, may his soul rest in peace.\\n \\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to\\nforce out the rebels in my country, I and some of my\\ncolleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila\\nto  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of\\nTwenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.\\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.\\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all\\nThis while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate\\nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty\\nand honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.\\nThus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share\\n(percentage) for assisting us.\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response.

       "  'message': \"From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,\\n          Johannesburg,South Africa.\\n\\nMy Dear ,\\n\\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\\n\\nMy name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!\\nd confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\\n\\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!\\ne's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\\n\\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\\n\\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\n\\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \\n\\n\",\n",

MICHAEL BUNDU. \\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. \\nTel No: Your country Intl. access code + 8821652098236\\nemail : mikebundu@rediffmail.com\\nDear Sir/Madam\\n\\n\\nSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. \\n\\nPlease permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. \\n\\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. \\n\\nThe security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \\n\\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. \\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \\nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \\n\\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. \\n\\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\\n\\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. \\n\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and God Bless. \\nBest Regards \\n\\n\\nCOL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). mikebundu@rediffmail.com\\n\\nN\\\\B.

       "  'message': \" From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,\\n          Johannesburg,South Africa.\\n\\nMy Dear ,\\n\\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\\n\\nMy name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!\\nd confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\\n\\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!\\ne's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\\n\\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\\n\\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\n\\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law.\\n \\nI am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. \\n\\nThe present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.\\n\\nMy sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. \\n\\nIt is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.\\n\\nThis man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.\\n\\nAll their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day.\\n His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of\\nhatred to my client's family. \\n\\nRight now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently.\\n \\nPresently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.\\n\\nThe existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.\\n\\nMadam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. \\n\\nAll we require from you is to help the family\\nto go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.\\n\\nSecondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies.\\n As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with\\nall the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. \\nPlease be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together.\\n\\n We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. \\n\\nPlease do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my secured\\nemail:clem-aputa@earthling.net\\n \\nI will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. \\n\\nRegards, \\n\\n\\nClement Apute.

       "  'message': \"Dear Sir I am mr Godwin Igbunu, the Bank Manager of Regent Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Berget made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Ministry of Defence headquater in Abuja that Mr. Roger Berget died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Berget did not declare any kin or relations in!\\n all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and not!\\narization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction better. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transactio!\\nn would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest. Best regards, Mr Godwin Igbunu Please you can also reach me with this email address igbunu2@caramail.com and telephone number 234-80232-97216 \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC. \\nI am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500,000.00 (forty two million, Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.\\nThe federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.        \\nAs I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business.\\nTo commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name & address, and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made.  Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness.\\nI look forward to receiving your prompt response.\\nBest regards, \\n\\nMOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'message': \"I am Dr Luisa Pimentel Estrada, the wife of Joseph Ejercito Estrada,former president of Philippines. I have children with my husband Jose, Jacqueline and Jude.Two sons and a daugther.This mail may be coming to you as a surprise or an article but it is very real.\\n\\nI gave the mail to my daugther Jude to send the mail to any contacts she sees and may be a God fearing person will listen to our plight.I will want you as the receiver to read through it and think very well if you can help or render us any assistance. My husband Joseph Ejercito estrada was elected as the 13th President of the Philippines in May 1998 by the people of Philippines due to his popularity in the film industry made him to win the largest popularity in the history of election in Philippines.He has attain the position of Senate in 1987,then vice-president in May 1992 and later become the president 1998.My husband became mayor of his hometown, San Juan in 1969 but it was 1972 that he had a string of public successes. My husband was named one of the ten Outstanding Young Men in Public Administration. He was also named Most Outstanding Mayor and Foremost Nationalist and Most Outstanding Metro Manila Mayor.\\n\\n My husband is recently accused of illegal acquire some four Billion Peso ($80M) during his 31 months in office as President backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators and Senate Traitors. They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file!\\n before my husband in the impeachment trial; \\n\\n1. Gov. Luis Singson, a longtime friend of my husband, said he provided the my husband with more than $8 million in payoffs from illegal gambling and $2.7 million from tobacco taxes. \\n\\n2. Witnesses testify one of an account in the Philippines third largest bank held millions of dollars in bribes collected by my husband. Equitable PCI Bank President George Go resigns. The banks senior vice president, Clarissa Ocampo, said she saw my husband sign a false name to documents withdrawing $10 million from a secret personal account. \\n\\n3. On Dec 31 Five synchronized bomb attacks kill 22 people and injure more than 120 in Manila, days before the trial is to return from holiday recess. Police accuse Muslim rebels but many fear the bombs may be linked to the trial. \\n\\n\\n4. That my husband received about $8.5 million in pay-offs from illegal gambling operators. 5. That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office. My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now and he detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City in hospital prison outside Manila where the life of my husband is in danger.I will let you know that it is political motivated by Gloria Arroyo.Meanwhile,the government has said that it may drop rebellion charges against my husband allies Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and the former ambassador to the United State Ernesto Maceda because they were in the side of my husband,both men were later jailed by the government of Gloria Arroyo that they instigated a march on the presidential palace by 50,000 supporters of my husband.These are all political.All these are done to have my husband death. Presently !\\nlife has not been easy for my children and I,my travelling documents have been seized by the government and they restricted me and my children to have access to my husband.\\n\\n Haven seen the way things are going with us.He decided to let me know that he deposited some money with Bank in Europe.He said that he deposited the sum of twenty Million dollars $20,000,000 in Banesto Bank Valencia Spain.Now I want to start a new life with the money.I want to invest the money outside Philippines.

However, by virtue \\nof our positions as civil servants and members of this \\npanel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the \\nnames of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have \\ntherefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my \\ncolleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas \\npartner into whose account we can transfer the sum of \\nU.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred \\nthousand U.S.dollars).

The source of the funds is as follows: During the \\nlast military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set \\nup companies and awarded themselves contracts that were \\ngrossly over-invoiced in various ministries and \\nparastatals. The present civilian government set up the \\ncontract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the \\ninstruments of payments made available to it by the decree \\nsetting up the panel, to review these contracts and if \\nnecessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. \\nMy colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of \\nthese funds which are presently floating in the Central \\nBank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to \\ndivert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue \\nof our positions as civil servants and members of this \\npanel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the \\nnames of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have \\ntherefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my \\ncolleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas \\npartner into whose account we can transfer the sum of \\nU.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred \\nthousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this \\nletter.\\nWe have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into \\nyour account, if you agree with our proposition as \\nfollows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for \\nus (the panel officials (iii)10% to be used in settling \\nall expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the \\nactualization of this project.\\nWe wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project \\nin foreign stock markets and other business till we are \\nready and able to have access to them without raising any \\neyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is \\n100% safe and risk-free. We\\nIntend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking \\ndays from the date of receipt of the following information \\nthrough the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank\\'s name, \\nCompany=92s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the \\naccount number into which the funds should be paid. The \\nabove information will enable us write letters of claim and \\njob description respectively. This way, we will use your \\ncompany=92s name to apply for the payment and backdate the \\naward of the contract to your company. We are looking \\nforward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit \\nfor your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. \\n\\nPlease acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my \\ndirect Telephone number 234 8033064962 and my America \\nInternet Fax number 1 92896 27169\\n\\nIt was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will \\nbring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction \\nwhen I hear from you.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nOBOH LUIS\\n\\n\\n_________________________________________________________ \\nGagne une PS2 !

The owner of this account is \\nPEDRO F. HASLER a foreigner,a great industrialist and he died\\nsince 1998.No other person knows about this account or any thing\\nconcerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation \\nproved to me as well that until his death he was the manager GOLD ARK [pty]. \\nSA.\\n\\nWe will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000] upon \\nsuccessful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall \\nre-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount to your account.\\n\\nThe total amount involve is Twenty six million United States Dollars only \\n[$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million United \\nStates Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before \\nthe rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a \\nforeigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, \\nwithout valid international foreign\\npassport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international \\npassport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US \\ndollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner too,and the money can \\nonly be approved into a foreign a/c.\\n\\nHowever, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together when we meet \\nface to face after the first transfer of $6 Million before transferring the \\nsecond part of $20 Million. I am revealing this to you with believe in God \\nthat you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the \\nonly person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently \\nso that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your \\nprivate telephone and fax number including the full details of the account \\nto be used for the deposit.\\n\\nI want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding \\nagreement that will bind us together immediately after the first transfer \\nbefore we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.\\n\\nI need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management \\nis ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct \\ninformation of this account, which I will give to you upon your\\npositive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet \\nup with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me \\nin this business. I need your strong assurance that you will\\nnever, never let me down.\\n\\nWith my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer \\nthis money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with \\nassurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in \\nyour country for sharing. The bank official\\nWill destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money \\nleaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can call me for \\nheart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone\\nwhich I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know \\nthat this business is confidential.I will use my position and influence to \\nobtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this\\nmoney to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant \\nministries and foreign exchange departments.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total \\namount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \\nhave incurred during the process of transferring.\\n\\nI look forward to your earliest reply through my email\\naddress.\\n\\nYours truly,\\nJeffery Hill.\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in =\\nexecution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.=\\n\\n \\n Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of =\\nProject Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have =\\nin our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.\\n \\n The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed =\\non behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the =\\nofficials\\n over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five =\\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has =\\nbeen paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.\\n \\n The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private =\\ninvestment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the =\\nreal engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has =\\ncontinued to encourage\\n investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere =\\ndetermination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to =\\ncontinue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation =\\nwith foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result =\\nwe included our bills for approvals with the\\n co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve =\\nBank of South Africa (RBSA).\\n We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, =\\nsince we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of =\\nbeneficiary\\\\'s information/details and other forms of\\n documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and =\\nits approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.\\n I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you =\\nbe willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will =\\nbe 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% =\\nshall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses =\\nso incurred.\\n It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the =\\nnature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major =\\ncontract and subcontracted it to other companies.\\n More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win =\\nmajor contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.\\n \\n This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost =\\nconfidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the =\\nsuccessful\\n execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my =\\nconfidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.\\n Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of this =\\nproposal.\\n \\n Regards,\\n \\n Dr. Benard Makelele.\\n   \\n--6afff921-4545-4b70-8138-4eebeab7d224--\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Until his demise, he held\\nsensitive positions in the military, and diplomat seat, one of\\nthe office he held , was the position of the personal assistant\\nto the U.N secretary general, Koffi Annan. His death was a shock\\nto the entire nation, the man in quote operates several foreign\\naccounts in our department which I mannage myself due to his\\nposition in the country. Such operations of accounts is called\\n\"Private Banking\" where the deposits will only be known to the\\nowner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge.\\n\\nNormally,65% of the total deposit is supposed to be turned into\\nthe Federal Government account and 30%, 5% given to the family\\nand bank respectively.  This is what the banking law and policy\\nof my country states, When this is achieved i.e transfer of the\\nFederal Government account part, the people at the corridors of\\npower withdraw these funds, under the disguise of security issues\\nbut make use of theseFunds for their personal and family use.\\nThis is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of the\\naccount and the family of the deceased. So I released the code of\\nthe account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit.\\nSince the code of the account is in between me and the deceased\\nthe fear of being checked is ruled out but I cannot make\\nwithdrawals from this account myself and that is where you come\\nin.\\n\\nAll you need to do for this transaction is to follow the\\nprocedure binding this contract together and I guarantee you\\nit&#8217;s risk free.

I was the Permanent Secretary of =\\nDefense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you =\\nis to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon =\\nJustice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper =\\nHelicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the =\\npossibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon =\\ntogether.\\n\\nDue to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel =\\nforces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need =\\nto purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 =\\nChopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices =\\nfrom Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for =\\nthe purchases, I was told to prepare a =93contract=94 for the purchases of =\\nthe Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and =\\nAccounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian =\\nsuppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was =\\ncarried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were =\\njunks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a =\\nyounger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived =\\nwith the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service =\\n(junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains.\\n\\nWhen Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released =\\nstating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State =\\nfor Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. =\\nPlease, check: (http://allafrica.com/stories/200212120154.html). =\\nNevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public =\\nservices. \\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire =\\nvaluable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the =\\ncase was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired =\\nproperties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my =\\nmoney from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. =\\nDue to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. =\\nMike Obodoh to be in charge of my projects.    \\n\\nThe money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money =\\nthat was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 =\\n(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could =\\nnot lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money =\\nwas packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a Holland =\\nnational, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded =\\nand well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the =\\ncontent. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current =\\nlocation to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Mike Obodoh who is =\\ncurrently in The Netherlands to transact this business with you since I want =\\nmy identity to be kept out of the money. \\n\\nWhat I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and =\\nwillingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. =\\nYou are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Mugelbe Jones whom I have =\\nauthorised to send this proposal to you in The Netherlands. As soon as you =\\nreceive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: =\\n(miobod@hotmail.com.) .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds =\\nand also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me =\\nin the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I =\\nwill also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and =\\nto engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. =\\nAt this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which =\\nthis business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence =\\nthat I repose on you.\\n \\nAs soon as I receive your response, we will discuss other modalities =\\nincluding remuneration for your services. You can also reach me on my email =\\naddress: drben211@yahoo.co.uk  \\nAs you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly =\\nconfirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Mike Obodoh. Bear in mind that =\\nthis project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your =\\nresponse.\\n\\nKind personal regards,\\nDR.

On the 6th of June 1998 an \\nAmerican miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with \\nus and his present balance is valued at \\nUS$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred \\nThousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We \\nsent a routine notification to his forwarding address \\nbut got no reply. After a month, we \\nsent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his \\nemployers that he died from an automobile accident. On \\nfurther investigation, we found out from his account \\nfile that he never made a will and all attempts to \\ntrace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. \\nWe therefore made further investigations and \\ndiscovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any \\nnext of kin or relations in all his official documents \\nin the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still \\nlying in the bank and the principal sum and interest \\nis being rolled over at the end of every year. As it \\nis now, no one will ever come forward to claim this \\nmoney. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration \\nof 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the \\nownership of the Government if unclaimed. \\n\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I would like you \\nto stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. \\nThis is simple; all we need is some of your details so \\nthat the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents \\nand affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. \\nMyers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services \\nof an accredited Attorney for the drafting and \\nnotarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary \\ndocuments and letters of probate/administration in \\nyour favour for the transfer. The money would be \\nshared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. \\n\\nThere is no risk at all as the paperwork for this \\ntransaction will be done by the Attorney and my \\nposition as a manager guarantees the successful \\nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested, \\nplease reply immediately via email. \\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality and be rest \\nassured that this transaction would be most profitable \\nfor us. I shall still require your assistance to \\ninvest my own share in your country just incase you \\ncan help, otherwise we'll take our share . \\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply, \\n\\nMr.Philip Jones. \\n\\n\",\n",

I am presently in Europe, where I \\nintend to look for a credible business partner to \\nassist my brother and I take physical pocession of a \\nconsignment of money, precisely US$25,500,000:00 \\n(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united \\nstates dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody \\nof my father in a security company in Ghana. \\n\\nMy parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his \\nwill he clearly stated that my brother and I should \\nlook for a credible individual who would assist us in \\ninvesting these funds, as we are not conversant with \\ninvestment procedures in the world business and we \\nhave never been in posession of such funds all our \\nlives. For these reasons, he believes that the only \\nway we can live without him is if we get someone very \\nvast in the field of business and investment to help \\nus claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we \\ncan further our educations, as well as living our \\nlives the way he wants us to. \\n\\nMy brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the \\nsecurity company, and he has asked that I travel out \\nto Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us. \\nI would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon \\nas I receive your response, so you can deal with him \\ndirectly, as he has all the modalties for the release \\nof the consignment. \\n\\nWe have both decided that we would make available to \\nyou for your assistance, 15% of the total sum of money \\ninvolved, but we have also decided to leave it open to \\nnegotiation. \\n\\nI would give you more details as soon as I hear from \\nyou. Till then I expect your prompt response. \\n\\nYours faithfully \\n\\nVENUS SAVIMBI \\n\\nN:B. REPLY TO:  venusavimbi02@themail.com\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n',\n",

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable \\nperson to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer \\nof a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but \\nexercise patience and read on. There were series of contracts executed by a \\nconsortium Multinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of \\nPetroleum Resources among which were:\\n1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down \\nstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million.\\n\\n2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries \\nin the country~ US$ 152Million.\\n\\n3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 \\nMillion. The original values of this contract were deliberately over \\ninvoiced to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been \\napproved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that \\nactually executed these contracts has been fully paid and project officially \\ncommissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the \\ntotal amount to your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil \\nServant and are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant \\nLaws) from opening operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, \\nthe trust posed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have \\nagreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside \\nfor accidental expenses (Internal & External) between the parties in the \\ncourse of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up an investment plan \\nfor us of which you will control since we cannot bring our shares back to \\nNigeria. We are very interested in investing in real estate in your country. \\nYou must however note that this transaction is subjected to the following \\ntermsand conditions:\\n\\n1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty anddiligence.\\n\\n2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and \\nconfidentiality because of thecircumstances we now find ourselves.\\n\\n3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have \\nabsolute control. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of \\nthe presidency at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of \\nthe funds within 14 working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above \\nstated terms. Our assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To accord \\nthis transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the \\nparties involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be \\nofficially and legally processed with your name or the name of your company \\nyou may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our \\nmain reason of contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to \\ninvest these funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be \\nofimmense help in this regards.\\n\\nKindly expedite action so as to enable us include this transaction into this \\nbatch as payment to foreign contractors is usually carried out on \\nquarterlybasis. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my private e-mail \\naddress:\\nBest regards,\\n\\nDR.DAN BELLO\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nTired of spam?

But I believe it is one day that you get to know \\nsomebody either in physical or through correspondence that iswhy i am now \\nin spain making this contart please  do call me on phone becaouse this is\\nvery urgent business. \\n\\nI got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of \\ncommerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite \\nastute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to \\nhandle a financial business transaction. \\n\\nHowever, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the \\ntraditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of \\nNigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 \\n(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late \\nfather the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as \\ncompensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil \\npresence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of \\nlivelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But \\nbefore his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged \\nsome funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary \\nstatus. The lodgment Security Code Number\\n\\nwas also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable \\nbusiness partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a \\nlucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this \\nis the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money \\nfrom the security firm to any country of your choice for investment \\npurposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the \\nfunds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your \\nchoice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had \\nintimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is \\nhis foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when \\ndue. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I \\nwill then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss \\nphysically on Investment potentials. \\n\\nBased on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% \\nof the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may \\narise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The \\nbalance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. \\n\\nI hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not \\ndrug money and it is not money from arms deal.\\n\\nThough you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this \\nmatter. I will give you\\n\\nall proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully \\nsatisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the \\nbeginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.\\n\\nNevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me \\nimmediately so that I will look for another contact. \\n\\nI am waiting for your quick\\n\\nresponse.\\n\\nYours faithfully\\n\\nPRINCE GEORGE DUKE\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I got your information from a personal search in the\\ninternet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential \\nco-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of\\nall \\nparties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature of\\nthis business.\\nWithin the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work\\nas a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operation\\nof four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue\\npayment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage\\nof the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a\\nforeign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced\\nto the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred\\nThousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost\\nhas been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance \\nunclaimed. \\n\\nSince the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign\\ncontractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations\\nwith foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.\\nAs a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operation\\nof some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve\\nBank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance as\\nthe beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed\\nto operate a foreign account. \\n\\nI have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,\\nshould you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share\\nas compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and\\nthe balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.\\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does contract\\nprojects of the nature described here. The assumption is that\\nyour company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other\\ncompanies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms\\nof unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more\\nspecialized firms for execution. \\n\\nI have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not\\ndisappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my\\n e-mail address above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this\\ndeal. If\\nyou are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner\\nto carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners\\nand myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim\\npossible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and\\nguarantee that our share will be secured.It is important that\\nyou treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as any form\\nof exposure will negatively affect us since we are still in active\\nGovernment Service. \\n\\nAlso your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful\\nexecution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in\\nyou and hope that you will not disappoint us. \\n\\nKindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance\\nof this proposal. \\n\\nRegards, \\n\\nEngr.Makalele Johnson\\n\\n\\n================================================== \\nSingle?

I am Michael Stevens Junior, the\\nson of Doctor. Simon Stevens. Who was murdered few months ago in Zimbabwe,\\nas a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he\\nhad taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United\\nStates dollars (US$15,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the\\nlooming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as\\nGemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed\\namount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the\\nfarms and establishment of new farms on Swaziland. As you may be aware this\\nland problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe\\nIntroduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some\\nblack farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by\\nZimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were\\nkilled because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the\\nvictims. It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are\\ncurrently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a\\nforeign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to\\nopen any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As\\nThe eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking\\na genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced\\nwith the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear\\nof going through the same experience in future since both countries have\\nsimilar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not\\nallow such investment from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your\\nassistance in the following:\\n1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the Netherlands so that we see\\nface to face, Have a table talk that would create confidence in me that the\\nfunds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate,\\nwhich will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in\\nthis transaction.\\n2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this transaction and claim\\nthe boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a\\nlocal bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your designated\\naccount in overseas.\\n3) Make a good arrangement for investment and do invest the money for me, I\\nam willing to give you some percentage for your assistance on this, and I\\noffer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any\\nother expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and\\nyou get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above\\nEmail, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss\\nfurther and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,\\nwhile you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction.\\nPlease kindly get back to me with your detail contacts.\\nSincere Regards,\\nMichael Stevens Junior.\\n  \\n--ad019be4-a42c-448d-86d8-9acccf8a00d2--\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.\\n\\nThe purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a\\nBusiness venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.\\n\\nDue to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert =\\nMugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white =\\nfarmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to =\\nsurrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his =\\npolitical party members and my father though black was the treasury of the =\\nfarmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not =\\nsupport the president's idea.\\n\\nHe then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to\\nInvade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my =\\nfather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\\n\\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my\\nFather Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with =\\ninstructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything =\\nhappen to him.\\n\\nThe will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash =\\nDeposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state \\ndollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to \\nthe company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS) \\nthat the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.\\n\\nThis money was deposited with this Private Security Company for\\nSafety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase\\nOf land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in\\nBotswana.\\n\\nThis violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of\\nMy beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.I was continually =\\nthreatened to abandon my inheritance from my father\\nAfter he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger\\nBecame unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe\\nWith the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from\\nAustralia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left\\nWith his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach\\nHim but all to no avail.\\n\\nI am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political\\nAsylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because\\nthe security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have\\nContacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in\\nJohannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands\\nwhich they have finally confirmed to me that the funds has sucessfully \\nbeing transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.\\nand that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the =\\ntransfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being =\\ndifficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a =\\nrefugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =\\nfinancial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable =\\nPartner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the =\\nconsignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the =\\nassistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn\\nwho has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand =\\nby me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my =\\nclaims from the security company.\\n\\nYou have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big\\nAnd brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of\\nthe safe keeping of this money.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist\\nWith arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from\\ntheir office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred\\n\",\n",

Myfather is \\nMr Johnson Koni and my mother is mrs Rose.s.Koni. I am a graduate of federal \\nuniversity of science and technology Harare,Zimbabwe and my discipline is \\nAgricultural engineering.After my graduation,I decided to work for my father \\nas his manager.My father has two big farms that are well known in Zimbabwe \\nand has many workers that were working for him.\\n\\nI managed my fathers farms for two years before we had in my country.I got \\nyour contact through network online decided to write you to explain my \\nsituation and request for your assistance.\\n\\nThis crises was as a result of a new land Act reform introduced by president \\nRobert Mugabe which wholly affected most white farmers and few black \\nfarmers.This resulted in the killing and mob action  by Zimbabwean war \\nveterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact a lot of people were killed \\nbecause of this land reform act of which my father was a victim.\\n\\nBut before the death of my father,  as if he knew he was going to die \\ninformed me about the money he deposited with a security and finance firm in \\nSouth Africa.The total amount is twenty three million,two hundred thousand \\nPOUNDS (M23,200,000,POUNDS) and this money was deposited in a box as germ \\nstones to avoid much demurrage from the Security and finance firm. This \\namount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the \\nfarms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.\\n\\nOne month after my father's death,I and my mother decided to travell to \\nSouth Africa for our lives and decided to look for a trustworthy foreigner \\nwho will help us to transfer this money out of South Africa\\nbecause we are staying as refugees here in South Africa and refugees are not \\nalowed to open bank accounts or involved in any financial transaction in \\nSouth Africa.I have all the documents concerning\\nthis money and what i am seeking for is a genuine foreign account where this \\nmoney could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who \\nare bent on collecting everything that belongs to my father.\\n\\nAll i am looking for is an honest business man or woman, whom I can entrust \\nmy future and that of my family . I must also let you know that this \\ntransaction is 100%risk free. If you accept to assist\\nme and my family all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and \\ncome to Johannesburg  South Africa, so that you can help me open a \\nnonresident account in your name which will aid us in transferring the money \\ninto any account you will nominate overseas.\\n\\nIf you are willing to help me,I have two options of compasaction for \\nyou,firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for \\nnominating your account for this transaction, Or you can\\ngo into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the \\nmoney in your country. Which ever the option you chooses,feel free to notify \\nme.\\n\\nI have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might \\nincure in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a \\npartnership I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining \\n70% will remain for me and my family.If you are realy capable and willing to \\nassist me please contact me immediately through my direct telephone number \\n+27-82-679-3775 or this e-mail address with which i have sent you this \\nmessage.\\n\\nFinally, please treat this matter as urgent as to save my family from much \\nexpences caused by demaurage being accumulating on daily bases for the money \\nin the security company.Thanks for your mutual\\nco-operation while i wait for your soonest response.Remain blessed.\\n\\nYours Faithfuly,\\nMR VINO.F.KONI\\n(for and on behalf of my family)\\n(vinokoni5@hotmail.com)\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nRain coat or t-shirt?

       "  'message': \"Good Day,\\n\\n\\n\\nWith warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,\\nand I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will\\nbe surprising to you to receive this proposal from me\\nsince you do not know me personally.\\nHowever, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this\\ntransaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a\\nperson of integrity.\\n\\nMy name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,\\nof the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered\\nin the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,\\nI decided to contact you through email, after searching\\nfor contacts via the internet, as it is the only means\\nI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with\\nZimbabwe for security and safety reasons.\\n\\nHowever, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The\\npurpose of this letter is to seek your most needed\\nassistance in a business venture. Due to the land and\\npolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President\\nRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly\\naffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black\\nfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my\\nfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business\\nforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in\\nmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit\\nthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred\\nthousand US dollars), in a private security company. This\\nmoney was deposited with this Private Security company for\\nsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for the\\npurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment\\nof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent\\nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the\\nmurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.\\n\\nI was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from\\nmy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but\\nwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder\\nattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the\\nHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my\\ndecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security\\ncompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and they\\nhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.\\n\\nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part\\nof the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee\\n(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved\\nin any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a\\ngenuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can\\nbe transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to\\nunderstand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future\\nand in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is\\nto assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the\\nsecurity company from their office in Netherlands,\\nas it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa\\nto their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you\\nrepresenting me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.\\n\\nFirstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your\\nassistance, and helping me open an account for the money\\nto be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with\\nme for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.\\nWhichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I\\nhave also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of\\nexpenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%\\n($580,000,00) for Charity donation.\\n\\nIf you prefer to accept the 10\\x0for assisting with opening an\\naccount,\\nthen 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want\\nyou\\nmaintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.\\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you\\nin\\nadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my\\ndirect line which is  31-630-854-650 or via email,\\nwolny_olkusz@latinmail.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nWolny Olkusz.\\n\\n\",\n",

The decision to write you is out of a sincere desire to establish a business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the international trade and commerce chamber (ITCC) in Madrid.\\n\\nMy name is Thomas Sesay Karimu, the son of John Karimu (former secretery of state for mining and industry) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Paul Koroma after over-throwing the elected government of President Tijan Kabba. Though, I don't know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC, CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years.\\n\\nSadly, my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45,000,000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.\\n\\nDue to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.\\n\\nIf you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nThomas Sesay Karimu.  \\n\\n\",\n",

This is\\nnecessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable\\nand trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem\\nstrange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence\\nand pray that you take my request very serious.I am\\nMr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.\\nF. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to\\n1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12\\nother Liberian Government officials was assassinated\\nas a result of a military coup that toppled the\\ngovernment of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May\\nhis soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family\\nhas always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.\\nYou can view our family web page below; \\n(http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)\\nbut please do not call me \\non the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed\\nbugged by the government.\\n\\nI received information from a reliable source that\\ndescribed your country as being economically conducive\\nfor investment and her people as transparent and\\ntrustworthy to engaging business, which made me to\\nwrite you. As you may want to know and to make you\\nless curious, I got your email address from an\\nInternet site that portrayed you in good light. \\nEarly this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the\\nremoval of\\nPresident Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good\\nexample of a bad leader. The President who needed\\nsupport from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum\\nof twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$\\n28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation\\nfor my late father and solicited for my support. I\\nquickly made an arrangement with a courier company\\nhere in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset\\nmanagement company in \\nthe uk. I did not support\\nPresident Charles Taylor because my conscience is not\\nfor sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in\\nLiberia, he placed all the eligible members of my\\nfamily under travel watch,confiscated all our\\ntraveling documents and frozen all our account in\\nLiberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia\\nand different peace keeping meetings were held and\\nPresident Taylor was advised to step down for national\\npeace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles\\nTaylor flied into exile but the problem we are having\\nnow is that he handed over power to his Vice-President\\nMoses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He was\\nthe person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all\\nour traveling documents and frozen all our account in\\nLiberia. That is why I requested for your sincere\\nassistance pending when a fresh election will be held\\nhere. The main rebel faction Liberians United for\\nReconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to\\ncontinue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The\\nrebels are not happy with the above development so\\nthey still continued fighting. \\n\\nWHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the\\nownership of the consignment /boxes containing the\\ncash to you and issue you a power of attorney through\\nmy Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to\\nthe money as my proxy from the company in europe.\\n\\nThe entire operation is risk free since it is only you\\nand me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the\\nmoney after you must have taken the money to your\\ncountry where it is save my lawyer will then meet you\\nin your country to use my share of the money for\\ninvestment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is\\nneeded to transfer this fund, I propose a commission\\nof 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for\\nthe expected services and assistance. Your private fax\\nand telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy\\nconclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life\\nnow) urgently. Your urgent response via the above\\nemail address is highly needed so as to stop further\\ncontact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to\\nexercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter\\nextra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision\\nwhile I await your prompt response. Our phone line\\nboth home and abroad are bugged. So don’t call me. I\\nwill always call you at my convenient time and in a\\nconducive atmosphere. PLS REPLY TO  chesson_joseph@yahoo.com\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nJ.Rodney Chesson. JR.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

My brother was pushed out of office\\nand charged with treason, corruption and embezzlement\\nof over 21 billion won. He was wrongly sentenced to\\ndeath but fortunately AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped in\\nand commuted the sentence to life. We thank God that\\nhe has finally been released though still under house\\narrest in the sense of the conditions of his freedom.\\nDuring my brother's regime as president of South\\nKorea, we realized some reasonable amount of money\\nfrom various deals that we successfully executed. I\\nhave plans to invest this money for my children=92s\\nfuture in real estate and industrial production.\\nBefore my brother was overthrown, I secretly\\nsiphoned the sum of $20,000,000.00 Million USD (Twenty\\nMillion United States dollars) out of Seoul and\\ndeposited the money with a Security Firm that\\ntransports valuable goods and consignments through\\ndiplomatic means.\\nI am contacting you because I want you to deal with\\nthe Security Firm and claim the money on my behalf\\nsince I have declared that the consignment belong to\\nmy Foreign Business Partner. You shall also be\\nrequired to assist me in investments in your country.\\nI hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will\\nnot sit on this money when you claim it, rather you\\nwould assist me properly.\\nI intend to give you 20% of the total money if you can \\nassist me claim these from the security company.When I\\nreceive your positive response I will let you know where \\nthe Security Firm is and the Payment Pin Code to claim \\nthe money which is very important. What I need is for you \\nto indicate your interest that you will assist me by \\nreceiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you \\nshall be considered to be the beneficiary of the money. \\nThe project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend \\nto carry out our proposed investments in your country, is \\npresently in the custody of a Diplomatic Courier Service Company\\nin Europe.\\nI cannot do this myself because I am presently living\\nin a Western European Country and my Status here is\\nthat of a Political Refugee and moreover I do not want\\nthe Government of my Country to know about\\nthe money because they will believe I got the money\\nfrom my brother while he was still in office as\\nPresident. Once you confirm the receipt of the money,\\nI would leave where I am presently located and come\\nover with my Children to your Country to start a new\\nlife with my Family.\\nAs soon as payment is effected, and the amount\\nmentioned above is successfully transferred into your\\naccount, I intend to use my own share in acquiring\\nsome estates in your country. For this purpose also,\\nyou shall be my project manager for the properties I\\nhope to acquire in your country and you will be paid\\nbased on a certain percentage agreed upon by both of\\nus.\\nFor now, let all our communication be by e-mail\\nbecause of the nature of this transaction but for more\\ndetails on this transaction you can contact my lawyer\\n(Bar Harry Fenadez) on this tel number 0031-630-674-930.\\nIt is very important you contact him because he will be\\nthe one to represent me in all legal matters to back this\\npending transaction since i cannot move at the momemt. \\nPlease send me your Telephone and Fax numbers as it\\nwould be better for me to get to you now by any of\\nthis means. This would be for our better peace of mind\\nbefore and after these funds are transferred into your\\naccount.\\nThe reason why it took this long to get to you was\\nbecause of the Security Firm's agreement with me which\\nwas that my brother must personally sign the Power of\\nAttorney that would transfer title to the prospective\\nbeneficiary. It was a long wait but it has now paid\\noff. His excellency, Chun Doo-Hwan does not want to be\\npersonally involved for security and personal reasons.\\nYour quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank\\nyou in anticipation of your cooperation.\\nYours faithfully,\\nJANG DOO-HWAN   \\n--b60f7216-d4dc-44c9-940c-ac95f2bc72af--\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'message': \"From: J. Rodney Chesson \\nChesson Family Corporation,\\nLiberia.\\nEmail: jrchesson@rediffmail.com\\n\\nKindest attention,\\n\\nI am very sorry for the informal manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.\\n\\nI am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President William\\nR. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. \\n\\nI received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.\\n\\nEarly this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. \\n\\n\\nI quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant, 54 was by picked b!\\n y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here. \\n\\nWHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US: \\n\\nI will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset management company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.\\n\\nYour private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So don't call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJ. Rodney Chesson.\\n\\n\\nN.B.

In his position (My father) =\\nwith the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila, he =\\nwas assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally =\\nin order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which =\\nalready had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.\\n Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he =\\nreceived on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila =\\nwhich force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of =\\nUS$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the =\\nHague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious  stones =\\nwhile the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the =\\nCongolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president, =\\nbut on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  =\\nfather suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  =\\nof our\\nnumerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was =\\nable to reveal this secret to me and advice that i should proceed to  the =\\nNetherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that=\\n\\nwill enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made =\\nmy first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  =\\nclearthis money is with a finance security company in Holland.\\n On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political =\\nasylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort  on the =\\nbest way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised\\nthat we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest =\\nthis fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because =\\nour refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we =\\nseek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.\\n I got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in =\\nBelgium. Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money =\\nthrough your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the =\\ntotalsum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the =\\ncourseof concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me =\\nand  my family. Also you stand to gain from any investment you might =\\nintroduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.\\n Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your =\\naccount for security reasons.\\n This is my e-mail address you can reach  me:(jameskyari22@netscape.net\\n Thanks and GOD bless.\\nMR, James Kyari  \\n--c5a98ae1-9b8c-419b-ac6e-d7ded9d717db--\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Now that God has called me, I\\nhave willed and given most of my properties and assets\\nto my immediate and extended family members and as\\nwell as a few close friends.\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and\\nso, I have decided to give alms to charity\\norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last\\ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed\\nmoney to some charity organizations in the\\nU.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has\\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any\\nmore. I once asked members of my family to close one\\nof my accounts and distribute the money which I have\\nthere to charity organization in Bulgaria and\\nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to\\nthemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as\\nthey seem not to be contempted with what I have left\\nfor them.\\nThe last of my money which no one knows about other\\nthan my distant relative who is presently in the\\nNetherlands is the huge cash deposit of 8 million\\ndollars that I have with a security company in\\nAmsterdam.\\nI will want you to help me collect this deposit with\\nthe assistance of my relative and dispatch it to\\ncharity organizations.If you are interested,please\\nemail my cousin at: paulz111@tiscali.co.uk\\nYours Truly\\nMr.Dada Abu.\\n------=_Part_3945_11365429.1067342384894\\nContent-Type: text/html\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\n\\n<P>Dear Friend,</P>\\n<P>As you read this, I don\\'t want you to feel sorry for<BR>me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.</P>\\n<P>My name is Dada Abu,a 74years old merchant,in the<BR>U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer<BR>which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in<BR>caring for my health.

But<BR>now I regret all this as I now know that there is more<BR>to life than just wanting to have or make all the<BR>money in the world.</P>\\n<P>I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to<BR>this world I would live my life a different way from<BR>how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I<BR>have willed and given most of my properties and assets<BR>to my immediate and extended family members and as<BR>well as a few close friends.</P>\\n<P>I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and<BR>so, I have decided to give alms to charity<BR>organizations, as I want this to be one of the last<BR>good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed<BR>money to some charity organizations in the<BR>U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has<BR>deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any<BR>more. I once asked members of my family to close one<BR>of my accounts and distribute the money which I have<BR>there to charity organization in Bulgaria and<BR>Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to<BR>themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as<BR>they seem not to be contempted with what I have left<BR>for them.</P>\\n<P>The last of my money which no one knows about other<BR>than my distant relative who is presently in the<BR>Netherlands is the huge cash deposit of 8 million<BR>dollars that I have with a security company in<BR>Amsterdam.</P>\\n<P>I will want you to help me collect this deposit with<BR>the assistance of my relative and dispatch it to<BR>charity organizations.If you are interested,please<BR>email my cousin at: <A href=\"mailto:paulz111@tiscali.co.uk\">paulz111@tiscali.co.uk</A></P>\\n<P>Yours Truly</P>\\n<P>Mr.Dada Abu.</P>\\n<P><BR>&nbsp;</P>\\n------=_Part_3945_11365429.1067342384894--\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In due respect\\nand\\nregard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be\\nvery beneficial to both of us\\nat the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my\\ndepartment,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced\\namounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We\\ndiscovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in\\ninternational\\nBank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on\\ncontract\\npayments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me\\nand\\nmy partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful\\nduring\\nthe time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact\\nthrough business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country\\nas I\\nwas making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this\\ntransaction.\\nMeanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund, as a payment\\nof\\ncontract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required\\napproval and transfer this money to a foreign account\\nhas been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed\\nto\\nyou as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us and\\nalso\\nbenefit yourself in this great business\\nopportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position\\nin\\nthis country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign\\naccount\\nand would eventually raise an eyebrow on my\\nside during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will\\nrequire\\na second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the\\ncontractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be\\ntranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due\\nverification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this\\ntransaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of this\\ntransaction, you would be entitlled to 30% as gratification,while 5% will be\\nset\\naside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer\\nand\\nalso telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and\\nmy partners.\\nPlease, you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in service\\nand\\nintend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will\\nbe\\nmonitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in your\\naccount,and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing\\naccording\\nto percentages.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I\\nhear\\nfrom you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish\\nin\\nthis deal.\\nYours Faithfully,\\nMr. Kazeem Ahmed\\nCHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT\\nAWARDING COMMITTEE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

My father went home for the funeral of the late president, =\\nbut on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  =\\nfather suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  =\\nof our\\nnumerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was =\\nable to reveal this secret to me and advice that we should proceed to  the =\\nNetherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that=\\n\\nwill enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made =\\nmy first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  clear =\\nthis money is with a finance security company in Holland.\\n On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political =\\nasylum; which was granted.

Though the actual contract cost\\nhas been paid to the original contractor, leaving the\\nexcess balance unclaimed.\\n\\nSince the present Government is determined to pay\\nforeign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain\\ngood relationship with foreign governments and\\nnon-governmental agencies.

This sum of US$11.183M has remained unclaimed ever since then and nobody has \\ncome \\nforward as his next of kin. The management under the influence of our chairman and member of the board of directors \\nhas  \\nmade an arrangement for the fund to be declared unclaimable  and subsequently be turned to the\\nreserve account of the bank.

LTD.\\nIDUMOTA BRANCH \\nLAGOS. - NIGERIA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Sir,\\n\\nI am Mr Kalada Hart, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria,\\nLagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business \\nproposition for you.\\n\\nOn September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with \\nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jerry Sheldon\\n made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, \\nvalued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. \\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding \\naddress but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and \\nfinally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian \\nNational Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from \\nan automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that \\nhe died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next \\nof kin was fruitless.\\n\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that \\nMr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his \\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. \\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the \\ninterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each \\nyear. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian \\nLaw, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the \\nownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\n\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the \\nnext of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's \\nlabor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government official\\ns. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full \\nnames and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary \\ndocuments and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. \\nWe shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization \\nof the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/\\nadministration in your favor for the transfer. \\nA bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then \\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. \\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of \\n70% for me and 30% for you.\\n\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be \\ndone by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees \\nthe successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, \\nplease reply immediately via the private email address \\nbelow. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details \\nand relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\\n\\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this \\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email.\\n\\nThanks and regards.\\n\\nMr.Kalada Hart\\n\\nConfidiential Email Address you should respond to: kaladah@yahoo.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Sharjah, United Arab Emirate UAE\\nEmail:dongakabaka555@yahoo.com\\n\\nDear Sir/Madam\\n\\nYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me\\nsince you do not know me personally. For the purpose\\nof introduction, I am Mr. Donga Kabaka, the son of Dr.\\nJames Kabaka, a wealthy black farmer/politician in\\nZimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my\\ncountry.\\n\\nThe land problem, in our country came when our\\nPresident Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win his\\nre-election, introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly\\naffecting the rich white farmers and the black farmers\\nwho are members of the opposition (MDC) party. This\\nresulted in killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war\\nveterans and some lunatics in the society. It is\\nagainst this background that I and my immediate family\\nhad fled Harare our capital for fear of our lives and\\nare currently staying in a country side of\\nUnited Arab Emirate. We are planning to leave\\nthe country and seek political asylum in Europe and we\\nhave decided to move our family wealth to Europe.\\n\\nWe got your contact through the Internet based on our\\nurgent need for a dependable and trustworthy foreign\\npartner and hence decided to write to you. Before the\\ndeath of my late father, he had taken me to\\nUnited Aram Emirate several times and had\\ndeposited the total sum of US$20.5 million (Twenty\\nmillion, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars),\\nin one of the private security companies, as he\\nforesaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was\\ndeposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoid\\nmuch demurrage from the security company. This amount\\nwas meant for the purchase of new machines and\\nchemicals for the Farms and the establishment of new\\nfarms in Swaziland.\\n\\nAs the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the\\nresponsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could\\nassist us without the knowledge of my government who\\nare bent on taking everything we have got, and the\\nUnited Arab Emirate seems to be playing along\\nwith them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this\\namount of money out of United Arab Emirate for fear of going\\nthrough the same experience in future.\\n\\nWe are seeking a partner whom I have to entrust my\\nfuture and that of my family in his/her hands. To this\\nend, we need your assistance to stand as the\\nBeneficiary of the Consignments in Europe. This is\\nbecause we are under restricted movement and watch and\\nhence we want to be very careful in order not to lose\\nthis fund, which we have worked so hard for. I have a\\nsufficient CONTACT person at the Security Company in\\nUnited Arab Emirate who can help us move this money to Europe\\nunder DIPLOMATIC COVER to another Security Company in\\nEurope with your details as the Beneficiary. This is\\n100% legal and will not pass through normal\\nCustoms/Airport Screening.\\n\\nThus, if you are willing to assist us to move this\\nfund out of UAE, you can contact me through\\nmy email address with your telephone, fax number and\\npersonal information to enable us discuss further\\ndetails. I must let you know that this transaction is\\nrisk free as far as we keep it as confidential as\\npossible. Thank you and many blessings to you.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\nMr. Donga Kabaka.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

My mother, Mary Momodu, is under investigation on a similar =\\ncharges.\\n\\nYou may have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland and\\nNorth America has been frozen. Following the outlined reasons for\\ninvestigation, I am soliciting for your esteemed organization's confidential\\nassistance to take custody of Thirteen Million, five hundred thousand United\\nStates Dollars (US$13,500,000.00) and also to front for my family in the\\nareas of business you consider profitable.\\n\\nThese Consignments containing the funds have secretly been concealed and\\ndeposited with a Diplomatic Security firm where it can easily be taken\\ndelivery of by a recommended beneficiary.

On our\\narrival in the Netherlands few weeks ago, we sought for political asylum;\\nwhich was granted.\\n\\nAlready, my sister and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle\\nthis money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek\\nfor a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a\\nprofitable venture.\\n\\nThis we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit\\nus to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you\\ncould be trusted.\\nMeanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through\\nyour account.

Though, this medium (Internet) has been =\\ngreatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the =\\nfastest, surest and most secured means for me to communicate with you at this =\\ntime.\\n\\nHowever, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be =\\ntreated as such. Official telephone calls and fax messages to me WILL NOT be =\\nentertained for security reasons and for the success of this project. For =\\nfurther briefing, you can reach me only via my private email address as =\\nstated below or through my lawyer whose contact shall be provided to you\\nin due cause.\\n\\nMy name is Mr. James Nicholas. I am the chief financial controller to Mr. =\\nCharles Taylor, the ex-president of Liberia who is presently on exile in =\\nNigeria.  As his private financial controller, I have access to his financial =\\nrecords more than any of his family members.\\n\\nMr Charles Taylor has over $1 billion dollars outside Liberia and his family =\\nmembers or people around him are not aware of this. With his present notion =\\nof arrest and following his restricted movement and the recent proclamation =\\nby Zurich authority, the U.N war crimes court and the America Government, has =\\nagreed that all Bank account belonging to Charles Taylor should be reported =\\nand freezed. \\n\\nTherefore I want to use this opportunity to make good money for myself. I =\\nhave worked for him for over 10 years and I have nothing to show for it. I am =\\nonly leaving on his empty promises and hopes.\\n\\nPresently, I have complete information to authorize with documents for =\\ncollecting /receiving $200 million from one of his financial sources in South =\\nAfrica. And I need your assistance in receiving the funds in Europe on my =\\nbehalf. Charles Taylor has prepared himself legally and secretly arranged =\\nwith Top most Government agents to transfer the funds upon instructions.\\n\\nIn light of the above, I am seeking your cooperation to act as the authorized =\\nbeneficiary of the said funds to enable us claim the funds for our mutual =\\nbenefit. As you probably already aware, Mr. Charles Taylor maybe handed over =\\nby his host country to the new Liberia Government to face trial soon hence =\\nthe need for urgent attention to this matter. \\n\\nYour prompt responce to my proposal will be highly appreciated. As soon as I =\\nreceive your geniue intention to cooperate with me, I will have my lawyer =\\nprovide you with the necessary details as required to enable us conclude this =\\ntransaction successfully. I thank you and look forward to hearing from you =\\nshortly.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nJames Nicholas\\nplease reply via my private e-mail below.\\ne-mail: jnicholas@zwallet.com \\n\\n..........................................\\n\\nBecause of charles Taylors notion of arrest, and with the present development =\\nthe security alert-ness is higher, so I will introduced my lawyer to you upon =\\nyour responce to my proposal.\\n\\n  \\n--fe9cadbd-1f37-4d61-9b24-181258a4b1d2--\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I will start\\nby\\nintroducing myself to you.\\n\\nI am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson Gracious\\nObaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief Executive,\\nNigerian National\\nPetroleum Corporation (NNPC). I am really sure that you\\nwill be of a\\ngood assistance after going thoroughly through this letter.\\nFor many years of marriage now between me and my husband, I\\nhave\\nnot given birth, and this has really troubled my husband.\\nAs a result \\nof the respect given to local tradition culture and custom\\nhere in \\nNigeria,my husband has decided to break the marriage. With\\nthe situation of things\\nwith me now, my matrimonial home look bleak. I am been\\nthreatened daily\\nby my husband to get out from the home. My Husband s\\nbrothers are not\\nleft outin this matter. \\n\\n\\nThis situation has really affected me psychologically.\\nAs at now, I am no longer Assured of a matrimonial home,\\nhence I seek\\nyour urgent assistance and help which I know will go a long\\nway in getting \\nme settled finally.\\n\\nI want to use this opportunity to move the sum of\\n(US$29.5M) into\\nyour custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in your\\ncountry. This\\nsaid amount was given to my husband as gratification from\\nsome Foreign Oil\\nCompanies he helped in getting Allocation for the Drilling\\nof Crude Oil\\nin Nigeria.\\n\\nAs a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hence\\nhe\\ngave me this money to keep in my personal account so that\\nhe can be\\nexonerated from the eyes of government security operatives\\nand the \\nCivil Service Commission (CSC) which is a body that\\nscrutinizes the activities of all\\ncivil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances for\\nofficial\\nmisconduct. Be informed that this money is not connected\\nwith drugs; money laundry,\\nfirearms and looting which I believe will put fears in you\\nto render the \\nrequired assistance needed from you and consequently\\nwithdrawing your help for\\nsecurity reasons.\\n\\nHence the source of this said money is clean and clear.\\nThis money was deposited in my personalin name, and\\nthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically under\\nthe banking\\nprocedures which could have been the easiest, but because\\nof monetary\\ntransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,\\nthat is\\ndefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to move\\nthis money out in cash to any\\ndestination where it will be easy for you to collect under\\ndiplomatic\\nimmunity.\\n\\nThis he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your response\\nand\\nwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish you\\non the next line of\\nacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transaction\\nis 100% risk free,\\nand my husband will not raise any alarm because he will not\\nlike to put\\nhimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, he\\nstands the\\nchange of loosing his job.\\n\\n\\nAs soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm to\\nme\\nthat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you up\\nthere in \\nyour country where I wish to live the rest of my life. I\\nwill be offering \\nyou 25% of this money for all your help at this time of\\nneed, while some\\npercentages has been  set aside for my Brother to\\ncomplement his efforts here. Be\\ninformed that this transaction will not last more than 14\\nworking days\\nand it will be concluded because every arrangement has been\\nput in place.\\nYour negative or positive response will be highly\\nappreciated.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nMrs. Rose Obaseki\\n\\n\\n \\n___________________________________________\\n Look Good, Feel Good www.healthiest.co.za\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I \\nwrote to you last \\ntime no response and I decided to write you again. \\n\\nI am Mr.Nze Moore from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the \\ncourse of our \\nauditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) floating in an \\naccount opened \\nin this Bank since 1996 and as from 1999 nobody has \\noperated on this account \\nagain, and after going through some old files in the \\nrecords I discovered \\nthat the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE] on oct \\n31 1999 by \\nplane crash, Egyptair flight 990, \\n(http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/)hence the \\nmoney is \\nfloating. \\nAfter due verification I noticed that no other person knows \\nabout this \\naccount except his wife who \\nwas also invovled in the crash, and the account has no \\nother beneficiary and \\nmy investigation proved to me as well that until his death \\nhe was the \\nDirector GOLD ARK [SARL] \\n\\nSince our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information \\nabout his death, we \\nhave been expecting his next of kin to come forward and \\nclaim his money \\nbecause we cannot release it unless somebody \\napplies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased \\nas indicated in \\nour banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody \\ncame up to this \\nbank as his next of kin or relative. It is therefore upon \\nthis discovery \\nthat I and other officials in my department now decided to \\nmake this \\nbusinness proposal to you and release the money to you as \\nthe next of kin or \\nrelation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \\ndisbursement since nobody \\nis coming forth and we don't want this money to go into the \\nBank treasury as \\nunclaimed Bill. \\n\\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be \\nused as the next \\nof kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the \\ncountry law here does \\nnot allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the \\nmoney will be \\nrecalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this \\nperiod. \\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the \\napplication form, \\nbank's contact and the next step to take. I will not fail \\nto bring to your \\nnotice that this business is hitch free and that you should \\nnot \\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can \\nbe finalized \\nwithin five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a \\nrelation to the \\ndeceased. \\n\\nWhen you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail \\nsignifying your \\ndecision.Including your private \\nTel/Fax numbers for quick communication. I will be very \\nhappy if you can \\ntreat this business with the \\nutmost secrecy it demands because of my position in this \\nbank. \\nHoping for a very successful business relationship with \\nyou. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n\\nMr Nze Moore.

I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.I am Mrs. Susan Martins the wife of Mr. John Martins of Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm.\\n\\nAfter the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$30,5 Million (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa, where we deposited it with a private  Security Company as a valuables in a box/consignment. This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.\\n\\nIf you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me as soon as you get this message please contact my son Wodi Martins immediately with the above telephone number (+27-732250444) or by email he knows also about this transaction. for details on how to execute this transaction to the satisfaction of everybody.\\n\\nFinally I want you to know that your ability to keep confidential information about this transaction is very important as all our hope for a better life depends on this money.\\n\\nBest Regard,\\n\\nMrs.Susan Martins\\n(For The Family)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

That's why I contacted you.\\nI am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business transaction, hence I decided to write to you.\\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company.\\nThis amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland. This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers.\\nThis resulted to killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank.\\nAs the eldest son of my father, I am given the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be transferred into as soon as possible for the investment of my family. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg,South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring this money into any account you will nominate overseas.\\nI have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me.

       "  'message': 'hello my dear,\\nmy name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!\\n e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso,though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place,ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us,we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask,please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest.\\naishatu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'message': \"KEN AMOBI\\nukpd@email.cz\\n\\nFor The Attention of: OWNER / CHIEF EXECUTIVE\\n\\nThis is for your urgent attention.  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.\\n\\nMy name is KEN AMOBI, a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country, the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee to take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also relieved of his position as the chairman.\\n\\nIn its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and company's information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairman's official study, which he left behind in his office.\\n\\nGoing through some of the files left behind by the former chairman, we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence, we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office, this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.\\n\\nI am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your company's name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this, we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your company's name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter.\\n\\nFor your participation and investing in this project, we are prepared to concede 30%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project, we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.\\n\\nI wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval, please respond immediately.\\n\\nEndeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.\\n\\nKEN AMOBI\\nukpd@email.cz\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'message': \"Attn: The President/CEO \\nI am Mr. Fred Mende, Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.\\nOn June 8, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.\\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. \\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email:fredmende4@rediffmail.com\\n\\nThanks and regards. \\nMr.Fred Mende. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Though I know that a\\ntransaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.\\n\\nPROPOSITION;\\nI am the account officer of a foreigner who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.\\nhttp://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html\\nSince his death, none of his next-of-kins has come forward to put claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident\\nhimself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). Though, the bank has made several publications to locate the family members, but all was not successful. We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.\\n\\nUpon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in \\nyour favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills and\\nthe money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it was as a result of this,we conceived the idea of searching for a foreigner who can apply as the next of kin/beneficiary. \\n\\nIt may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate division an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please\\nacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following informations, if you are interested.\\n\\n1.A Beneficiary name? In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name.\\n2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other. We shall be compensating you with 25% on final conclusion of this project, we have set aside 5% for expenses and 70% shall be for my colleagues and I.\\nI intend to retire after the conclusion of this\\ntransaction. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endevour to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed\\non you,\\n\\nI await your urgent mail to my personal Email:julliet06@3xl.net\\n\\nRegards,\\nMrs Julliet Abrams\\nTel: 00229 07 14 19\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nFaites un voeu et puis Voila ! www.voila.fr \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Your professional status is not a matter of hindrance in =\\nthis transaction. Please, your assistance is highly solicited.

I write \\nthis letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of  US $ 20 000,000.00\\n with you. I inherited this funds from my mother. This funds was generated \\nthrough the sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the \\nhead of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege \\nposition to engage in the business of Diamond and timber since she knows\\n that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the \\nprivilege situation.\\nWhen my father was assassinated on 16th January 01 by one of his \\nbodyguards Lt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some Top Army \\nofficers that wanted to topple his government, I escaped to Cameroon \\nbecause of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph \\nKabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are \\nnot in the best of relationship because of tussle for who among them \\nwill be the first lady and this ultimately affected us their children.\\n\\nConsidering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic \\nRepublic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave for \\nCameroon for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a \\nsecurity Company.\\n\\nOn getting to cameroon where I have been living since then \\n I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me \\nin moving this funds out for safe banking and profitable foreighn \\ninvestment. \\nHonestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this funds in \\nCameroon nor Africa due to my status in my country as a result of my \\nfathers death.\\n.And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this funds is all that I and my \\nmother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father's\\nassets and funds and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing \\nthat this funds was deposited at the security company. so this is why I \\ndecided that investing this funds abroad should be the best safest typy \\nof adventure for me. I will be honoured if I can be given the privilege of \\ninvesting this fund through your help.\\n\\nIn view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough \\nto respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a \\nhopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your \\nsincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total fund and annual \\n5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. \\nThereafter, the terms shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise \\nduring this transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive,When the fund \\n($20,000,000.00) is moved into your discrete account, you will be \\nallowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 75% will be invested \\nmeaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and \\ndeterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends \\nyeilding.\\nShould you for any reason not interested,please kindly reach me so as to\\n make other contacts and please try  to keep this letter tight secret for the \\ninterest of my family.\\n\\nBest regards.\\n\\n\\nJOHN KABILA\\n\\n\",\n",

Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25 years old and studying Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in NOVEMBER27th LAST year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has One Hundred and Five Million  United States Dollars   (USD105,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Bank . He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My moth!\\n er did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father’s properties, companies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of !\\n God, you will help us move this money out of the {BANK} to your coun\\ntry where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.

I am the son of Dr. David\\nCarlos who was recently murdered in the land dispute in\\nZimbabwe. I got your contact through Network on line in my\\nsearch for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very\\n\\nConfidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund\\nto a foreign account and I decided to write you, My Late\\nFather was among the few Black Zimbabwean Rich Farmers\\nmurdered in Cold Blood by the agents of the ruling\\ngovernment of President Robert Mugabe for his alleged\\nsupport and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party\\ncontrolled by the white minority. \\n\\nBefore his death he had taken to Johannesburg - South\\nAfrica to deposit the sum of US$ 18.5 Million (Eighteen\\nMillion Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with\\nSecurity and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming\\ndanger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a Box as \\nValuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security\\nCompany. This money was embarked from the purchase of New\\nMachinery and Chemical for Farms and the establishment of\\nnew farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. \\n\\nThis land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe\\nintroduced a new land act that wholly affected the Rich\\nWhite Farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the\\n\"Modus Operandi\" adopted by the government.  This resulted\\nto rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and\\nsome political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-one (31)\\npeople have so far been killed. Heads of governments from\\nthe west, especially Britain and United States of America\\nhave voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan.\\nSubsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C)\\nhas continuously supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it is\\nagainst this background that I and my family who are\\ncurrently residing in South Africa have decided  to\\ntransfer my Father\\'s money into a Foreign Account. \\n\\nAs the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the\\nresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where\\nthis money could be transferred without the knowledge of my\\ngovernment who are tactically freezing our family wealth\\nand South Africa\\'s government seems to be playing along\\nwith them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this\\nmoney in South Africa for fear of encountering the same\\nexperience in future since both countries have almost the\\nsame political history. More so, the South African Foreign\\nExchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are\\nseeking for an \"ASYLUM\".\\n\\nAs a businessperson whom I entrusted my future and that of\\nmy family into his hands, I must let you know that this\\ntransaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your\\nbusiness does not necessarily matter. For your assistance,\\nwe are offering you 30% of the total sum, 60% for Me and My\\nFamily while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may\\nincurs during the course of this transaction. We wish to\\ninvest our part of the money on commercial property based\\non your advice.\\n\\n\\nFinally, all we demand from you is assurance that you will\\nnot sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal\\nor company\\'s account in your country. If this proposal is\\nacceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the\\nabove TEL and or E-MAIL me.\\n\\nThanks and God Bless you.\\n\\nBest Regards.\\nJohn Carlos\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________________________________________\\nHerbalife Independent Distributor http://www.healthiest.co.za\\n\\n',\n",

Though I assisted him in getting this contract but\\nI never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid\\nthat the government of South Africa might start to\\ninvestigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date. If they\\ndiscover this money in his bank account, they will\\nconfiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and\\nthis will definitely affect my political career in\\ngovernment.

As soon\\nas the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move\\nit immediately into another personal bank account in your\\ncountry.\\n\\n I will see to it that the account is not traced from South\\nAfrica. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your\\naccount, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come\\nto your country to discuss on business investments. For\\nyour assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum\\nwhich amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred\\nThousand United States Dollars Only)And 5% will be for Any\\nexpenses that both of us may Incure in this transaction.\\nAnd another 5%will go for Motherless babes home.\\nHowever, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into\\nagreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.

Due to my sensitive position in the South\\nAfrican Government, I prefer you send me email than call.\\nAll correspondence must be by email to my private email\\naddress, {susanshabangu00@netscape.net} If you want to\\nspeak with my Banker or my elder son,that is fine and okay\\nby me.you can contact my son on his dilect line\\n{+27-73-323-0163}his name is {MR Morris shabangu}and You\\nwill have to send down you private telephone /fax number so\\nthat i can forward it to him to reach you from time to time\\nthis is for security reasons.

With warm =\\nheart I offer my friendship, and greetings,and I hope this mail meets you in =\\ngood time.I have mused over your profile for sometime and decided to contact =\\nyou in this regard. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to =\\nyou, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,I humbly =\\nask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I =\\nalso sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a =\\nperson of integrity.\\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is =\\nMr.Robert Savimbi,I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro =\\nSavimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of =\\nAngola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an =\\ninternet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. \\nMy Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led =\\nby President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death,Mr. =\\nAntonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, =\\nassumed office as leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had =\\ncarried the party with in Dembo and general lukamba,\\nthere was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos =\\nMorgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to enrich =\\nthemselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, =\\nincluding Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension\\nand confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr.Dembo died 10days after =\\nmy Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for =\\nthree decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as =\\nthere is now no sense of direction. I now\\ndesire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For =\\nthis reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek political =\\nasylum.\\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in =\\nrespect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds =\\nsales. This money (Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its =\\nway to my Uncle's Swiss Bank\\naccount, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on =\\ntransit with a private safe deposit security company here in =\\nAmsterdam,Netherlands. in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's =\\ndeath occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment =\\ncontaining the money pending on further instructions from me.

My share of the money will be returned =\\nto me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have =\\npermission to do business and open an account here. \\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the =\\nMoney of the money. \\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the =\\nfunds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the =\\nrelease codes of the vaults.

       "  'message': 'Dear Sir,\\n\\nIt is with hope that I write to seek your help in the context below.\\nI am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria’s former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.\\n\\nThe security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is so traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. \\n\\nYou must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. \\n\\nInfact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I came in contact with your name and address in a website and would want to have good confidence in you as I view you to be a responsible personality. \\n\\nI have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody( for safety) the sum of $50 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband’s property is under the authority of the family’s Lawyer (Attorney)Barrister MIKE AHAMBA(SAN).\\n\\nThe investigative teams set up by government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the $50m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons. \\n\\nAll our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized. This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your goodself with 10% of the total deposit when you finally the deposit box from the security firm and lodged in your account. \\n\\nThey have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me,you can write me through my e-mail, please reply direct to this email address; dr_mrsabacha@sify.com  for obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our communication very secret. Donot mention my family\"s name or disclose the transaction to anybody.\\n\\nIf you are not interested in assisting me, still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nHajia mariam Abacha\\nEMAIL: dr_mrsabacha@sify.com\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I got your contact through the Ghana =\\ninformation Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person =\\n to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of =\\nfund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.\\nMy late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party =\\nwas dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF.

The money was deposited in two sealed =\\nboxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I =\\nmost say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to =\\ngo back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed =\\nany concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life =\\nwas no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am =\\nresiding now with my own family.\\nMeanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don=92t think of going back and for =\\nthis I and my family have decided to transfer my father=92s money into a =\\nforeign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am =\\nsaddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where =\\nthis money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who =\\nhave tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of =\\nAfrican government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such =\\ninvestment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must =\\nentrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know =\\nthat this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does =\\nnot necessarily matter.\\nTherefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer =\\nyou 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while =\\n5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of =\\nthis transaction.

       "  'message': \"FROM BONGO WALE\\nJOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.\\nTELL:+27-732112866.\\n\\nDear sir,\\n\\nI am MR, BONGO WALE, the son of late\\nMR.PATRICK WALE, who was murdered in a land dispute\\nin ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for\\nreliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential\\nfinancial transaction, then I decided to write you. My\\nlate father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich\\nfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the\\nruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his\\nalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition\\nparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to South\\nAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars\\n($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he\\nknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was\\ndeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much\\ndumourage from the security firm.\\nThis money was earmarked for the purchase of new\\nmachinery and chemicals for the farms and the\\nestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.\\nThis land problem arose when President R. MUGABE\\nintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the\\nWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently\\ncondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the\\ngovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mob\\nactions. I and my family who are currently staying in South\\nAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decided\\nto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the\\nTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher\\ntransfer of the money to a foreign country where we\\ncan invest it.

OMAR ALI JUMA, and he =\\nwas the VICE PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA. Before he died, my father =\\ndied at the age of 63 in the year 2001 after addressing fellow TANZANIANS =\\nduring the visit of PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA of DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO =\\nand YUERI MUSEVENI of UGANDA. I got your contact through the Ghana =\\ninformation Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person =\\n to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of =\\nfund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.\\nMy late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party =\\nwas dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF. IBRAHIM LIPUMBA. Before his =\\ndeath he had taken to Europe  to deposit the sum of US$40 million (FORTY =\\nMILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and finance company as if he =\\nforesaw the looming danger coming. The money was deposited in two sealed =\\nboxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I =\\nmost say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to =\\ngo back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed =\\nany concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life =\\nwas no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am =\\nresiding now with my own family.\\nMeanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don=92t think of going back and for =\\nthis I and my family have decided to transfer my father=92s money into a =\\nforeign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am =\\nsaddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where =\\nthis money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who =\\nhave tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of =\\nAfrican government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such =\\ninvestment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must =\\nentrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know =\\nthat this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does =\\nnot necessarily matter.\\nTherefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer =\\nyou 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while =\\n5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of =\\nthis transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on =\\nyour advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you =\\nwould not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal =\\nor company=92s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.\\nBEST REGARDS\\nDR. RANI ALI JUMA.\\n  \\n--d6b9cac0-c60a-11d8-8772-0004aca2aa72--\\n\\n',\n",

Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by the sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).\\n   This money was kept in a Security Company in Spain and I have \\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on ou!\\n r family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband. My first son Mohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts abroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.\\n  In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas account, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in!\\n  this regard with 25% of the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure (There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by you.)during the process of securing this fund.The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. \\n  My cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.\\nAnd in due course, all contacts must be made through\\nDR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 00 221 5124859.\\nE-mail address: kadiri_hammed@elvis.com\\nI look forward to your quick response while thanking\\nyou for your co-operation. In view of all above\\ndetails, I request you to keep this letter and\\nco-operation highly confidential.\\nBest wishes,\\nDR.(MRS). MARIAM ABACHA.\\nABACHAS LODGE,KANO.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Further more your area of\\nspecialization will not be a hindrance to the\\nsuccessful completion of this transaction. I have\\nreposed my confidence in you and hope you will not\\ndisappoint me.

Literally speaking he  gave cover to the\\nrebel Leaders. This operation was code named: Conflict\\nDiamond. I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the\\nsub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of\\nDollar.\\n\\nWhile carrying out this operation, I was able to divert\\nthe sum of US$45,000,000.00 (Forty-Five Million\\nUnited States Dollars) for my personal benefit, and\\nit is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as\\nartifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit \\n in Accra-Ghana. \\n\\nThe Security Company does not know the\\ntrue contents of the consignments.

       "  'message': \"Dear Sir or Madam:\\n\\nWe are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:\\n\\nI. Background:\\nShengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. (http://www.sinopec.com), as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. \\n\\nII. About us\\nShengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Factory is one of sub-companies of Shengli Oilfield Co., Ltd, with total assets of 267 million yuan, net assets of 170 million yuan and 2462 staff. The factory mainly produces oilfield special equipment such as beam unit, Spiral-seam submerged-arc weldedsteel pipe, sucker rod, line pipe, casing, tubing, plastic compound pipe etc. It produces 200,000 tons of line pipes, 1 million meters of strengthened plastic compound pipes, 500 beam units, 2.5 million meters of sucker rods, 12,000 tons of PP gas pipes and 50,000 tons of oil tubings yearly, and has become important pipe base in Shandong and Shengli Oilfield. Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.\\nThe Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.\\n\\nIII. Content of the project\\nIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.\\n\\nIV. Product specifications\\nFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from ¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7\\nFor delivery: grade of steel are X52¡¢X60¡¢X70, specification ranges from ¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7.\\n\\nV. Economic Analysis\\nThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.\\nThe break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.\\n\\nVI. Plans for cooperation\\nWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:\\na. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35£¥\\nb. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30£¥\\nc. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10£¥\\nd. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25£¥\\n\\nTo meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.\\nWe would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment.

These accounts had been dormant since the end of World \\nWar II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\\nThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\n(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\naccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\\nThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\ninterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\nboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\nNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\nwere interest bearing when established.\\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\non accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE \\nwith a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest \\nwas discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust \\nera, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. \\nThe Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all \\nunclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing \\ncredit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by \\nthe law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died \\ninterstate (living no wills).\\nBeing a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary \\ncontacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be \\nbanked in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds and \\nwe can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.\\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim \\nthe funds.

The owner of this account is Mr. Jurgen T.Dormann, a foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Jurgen T.Dormann until his death was the Coy. (pty). SA. \\n\\nWe will start the first transfer with Twenty four million [$24,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount of ($ 40,000.000.00 USD) to your account.\\n\\nThe amount involved is ($64,000.000.00 USD) Sixty four million United States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $24,000.000.00 [twenty four million United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.Jurgen T.Dormann is a foreigner too, and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.\\n\\nHowever, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your contact address from South Africa chamber of commerce, I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.\\n\\nI need your full co-operation to make this work fine. Because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.\\n\\nWith my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account.\\n\\nI will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount, 55% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.\\n\\nI look forward to your earliest reply to phone and fax number below or [mattewmolefe1@yada-yada.com]\\n\\nRegards,\\nMR.MATTEW MOLEFE.\\n\\n77 Seaside Cottages \\nFish Hoek-Cape Town\\nSouth Africa\\nTEL: 874-76 3619434\\nFAX: 874-76 3619436\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'message': \"Dear Sir or Madam:\\n\\nWe are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:\\n\\nI. Background:\\nShengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. (http://www.sinopec.com), as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. \\n\\nII. About us\\nShengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Factory is one of sub-companies of Shengli Oilfield Co., Ltd, with total assets of 267 million yuan, net assets of 170 million yuan and 2462 staff. The factory mainly produces oilfield special equipment such as beam unit, Spiral-seam submerged-arc weldedsteel pipe, sucker rod, line pipe, casing, tubing, plastic compound pipe etc. It produces 200,000 tons of line pipes, 1 million meters of strengthened plastic compound pipes, 500 beam units, 2.5 million meters of sucker rods, 12,000 tons of PP gas pipes and 50,000 tons of oil tubings yearly, and has become important pipe base in Shandong and Shengli Oilfield. Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.\\nThe Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.\\n\\nIII. Content of the project\\nIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.\\n\\nIV. Product specifications\\nFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from ¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7\\nFor delivery: grade of steel are X52¡¢X60¡¢X70, specification ranges from ¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7.\\n\\nV. Economic Analysis\\nThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.\\nThe break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.\\n\\nVI. Plans for cooperation\\nWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:\\na. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35£¥\\nb. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30£¥\\nc. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10£¥\\nd. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25£¥\\n\\nTo meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.\\nWe would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment. And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.\\nFor additional information regarding this project, please feel free to contact us.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt reply.\\n\\nSincerely yours, \\n\\nTony Leung\\nProject officer\\n\\nTel: +86-546-833 9362\\nFax:+86-546-832 9817\\nMobile: +86-133 4505 3225\\nEmail: tony@mpbdy.com\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'message': \"Dear Sir/madam,\\n\\nThis letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person nor by\\ncorrespondence, but I believe that it takes just one day to meet or know\\nsomeone either physically or through correspondence.\\n\\nI got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as being\\nquite astute in private Entrepreneurship, one has no doubt in your ability\\nto handle a financial business transaction.\\n\\n\\nHowever, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty  Pepple Y. William, the\\ntraditional ruler of Bonny province in the Oil rich area of Rivers state in\\nNigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of USD45, 000,000.00\\n(Forty Five Million United States Dollars), which I inherited from my late\\nfather.\\n\\nAs You may be aware that my country is the third largest oil producing\\ncountry in the whole world. My father is the ruler of the richest community\\nin Nigeria. My community produce 5.8% of the total annual Oil production in\\nNigeria and 0.5% of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father as\\nroyalty by the Federal Government to our community. In his position as the\\nroyal head and chairman of the Bonny Oil trust fund.\\n\\n\\nForeigners often refer to his kingdom as the Gas/Oil Land. This is because\\nthe island floats atop one of the largest gas and oil deposits anywhere in\\nthe world. This explains is why the island is home to several Multinational\\noil companies, such as Shell, Exxon-Mobil, Chevron and one of Nigeria's most\\nexpensive ventures in recent time, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company\\n(NLNG), these companies also offers my father a lot of gratifications as the\\nroyal father of the kingdom where they operate.\\n\\nSome of this money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as\\ncompensation by the Oil firms located in our area, for hampering Agriculture\\nwhich is our main source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from\\nprotracted diabetes. Before his death secretely he willed the sum of USD45,\\n000,000.00 (Forty Five Million United States Dollars) and he safely\\ndeposited this money in cash into a consignment and kept it in the custody\\nof a security company without the security company knowing the content.\\n\\n\\nI have the certificate of Deposit and any information you wish to have as a\\nproof to show for it.\\n\\nMy problem actually started when my stepmother said that the next king must\\nbe her son instead of me as the heir apparent to the throne. I am the first\\nson of my father but my stepmother has used her position and influence to\\nconvince some members of the council of elders that my biological mother was\\nnot properly married to my father because my mother is not living in the\\npalace due to some problems within the family before the death of my father.\\nThis action by my step mother is just a bid to deny me of my right, which I\\nchallenged. In the process  there was confusion that divided the community\\ninto two factions. This led to a revolution by the youths and women who are\\nsolidly behind me. Consequently, my international passport was seized just\\nto stop me from traveling outside the country.\\n\\n\\nNow I need help. I need someone who will claim the fund my father deposited\\nwith the financial security company and deposit it in his/her personal\\naccount pending when I will be free again. Please, help me to salvage the\\nonly hope of survival that I now have of which my step mother and the\\nchildren do not know about this money.\\n\\n\\nI am in need of help to safe guide this money so as to settle down and fight\\nfor my rightful throne. Right now, I am in hiding and I do not want this\\nmoney to stay much more in the security company because I don't want to\\nincur extra cost on the deposit since I don't know how long my problem will\\nlast.\\n\\n\\nIf you can help me in this my time of need, I will give you 20% of the total\\nsum, while 80% will be kept for me.\\n\\n\\nI look forward to your helping me.\\n\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n\\nPrince Yobo William\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

This business request may seem strange, but\\nI crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am\\nconvinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to\\na money transfer.\\n  On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with \\nPetroleum Corporation, Mr.Robert Rice  made a numbered  time (fixed)\\ndeposit for twelve calendar months,\\nvalued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars\\n)in  my branch upon maturity.

This is simple, I will like you to provide\\nimmediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will\\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in\\nplace as the next of  kin.We shall employ the service of an attorney\\nfor the drafting and notarization of the Will and obtain the\\nnecessary\\ndocuments and letter  of probate administration in your favour for\\nthe transfer.\\n  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide\\nwill  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\\nbeneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for\\nus to share in ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you..

The bank manager of\\nAMALGAMATED BANK OF South Africa (ABSA). There is an\\naccount opened in this bank in 1982 and since 1990, nobody\\nhas operated in this account again. After going through\\nsome old files in the records, I discovered that if I do\\nnot remove this money out urgently, it would be forfeited\\nfor nothing. The owner of this account is MR. ADAMS\\nCOLEMAN, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold company, a\\ngeologist by profession and he died since 1990. \\n\\nNo other person knows about this account or anything\\nconcerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my\\ninvestigations proved to me as well that his company does\\nnot know anything about this account. The amount involved\\nis US$18m (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS). I am\\nonly contacting you as a foreigner because this money\\ncannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be\\napproved to any foreign Account because the money is in US\\nDollars and the former owner of the account is MR. ADAMS\\nCOLMEAN is a foreigner too. I know that this message will\\ncome to you as a surprise as we don?t know ourselves\\nbefore. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is\\nreal and a genuine business. \\n\\nPlease reply or call me urgently so that I will inform you\\nthe next step to transfer this fund to your resident Bank\\nAccount immediately. Send also your private telephone and\\nfax numbers including the full details of the account to be\\nused for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or\\nsign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you\\ncan receive this money into a foreign account or any\\nAccount of your choice where this money will be safe. And I\\nwill fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other\\ninvestments. \\n\\nI am contacting you because of the need to involve a\\nforeigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I\\nneed your full co-operation to make this work fine because\\nthe management is ready to approve this payment to any\\nforeigner, who has correct information of this account,\\nwhich I will give to you later immediately, if you are\\ncapable and willing to handle such amount in strict\\nconfidence and trust according to my instruction and advice\\nfor our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never\\ncome again in my life. I want you to be truthful in this\\nbusiness, because I don?t want to make mistake, I need your\\nstrong assurance and trust. \\n\\nWith my position now in the office, I can transfer this\\nmoney now to any foreigner?s reliable account, which you\\ncan provide with assurance that this money will be intact\\nbending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I\\nwill destroy all documents of transaction immediately you\\nreceive this money, leaving no trace to any place. You can\\nalso come to discuss with me face to face after whom I will\\nmake this remittance in your presence and two of us will\\nfly to your country at least two days ahead of the money\\ngoing into the account. \\n\\nI will apply for my annual Leave to get visas immediately I\\nhear from you that you are ready to act and receive this\\nfund in your account. I will use my position and influence\\nto effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money\\nto your account with appropriate clearance forms of the\\nministries and foreign Exchange departments. At the\\nconclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the\\ntotal amount, 70% will be for me, and while 5% will be for\\nexpenses both parties might Have incurred during the\\nprocess of transferring. I look forward to your earliest\\nreply through my e-mail or you give me a call through my\\noffice line. \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nDAVID MORGAN. AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.

Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant for a \\nsecret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in europe \\nthe deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S dollars) this \\nwas the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in the heat \\nof the conflict.

Prior to her death, she handed me over a certificate meant for a \\nsecret deposit, which my father made in a security/finance company in europe \\nthe deposit that worth US$25,000,000 ( Twenty five million U.S dollars) this \\nwas the money paid to his corporation by it's overseas customers in the heat \\nof the conflict. He made the deposit in his name and also deposited it as a \\nfamily tresures, with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the \\nend of the war but he was killed when the conflict intensified as a result \\nof his opposition to the rebel forces. I have contracted the \\nSecurity/finance Company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.\\n\\nDue to the death of my Mother, I have decided to solicit for the \\nparticipation of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will \\nassist in acting as my representative who will jointly signed the agreement \\nfor the safe keeping of the money in the security/finance company. The \\nsecurity/finance company don't know the content of the consignment, they \\nbelieve that it is African artefact. As contained in 2 trunk boxes. \\nUnfortunately, My mum who is surpose to assist me in releasing the \\nconsignment has died of cancer that is why I am looking for your assistance. \\nI cannot do it alone due to my present social status and total ignorance of \\nthe business world. I shall also give you 20% of the funds for your \\nassistance to relocate this fund to your country and for re-investment while \\nthe rest will be kept in any account of your choice for inverstmant purpose. \\ni would have done the transfer myself as my name is written as the next of \\nkin,but because of my present status in this country as a refugee i will not \\nbe allowed to handle such money or else it will be confisticated by the \\ngoverment if found in my possetion,and also i will not be allowed to open an \\naccount as a refugee not even to talk of inversting such an amount of \\nmoney,these are the reasons why i need your assistance,If you are interested \\nin helping me out of this my present situation, contact me immediately \\nthrough my email and i will funish you with other details you need to \\nconclude this transaction.this transaction is absolutely risk free and of \\nbiliteral benefits as i have all neccesray legal documents backing it \\nup.please get back to me with your full name,tel.no fax no and also your \\nhome addres so as to enable me introduce you to the security/finance company \\nhandling the consignment as my representative.after all these you will then \\nmake an arrangement on how we are going to meet face to face and discuss in \\ndetails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I cannot travel out because i have no travelling documents for \\nnow,i also hope that after everything you will secure a visa for me to join \\nyou in your country so that i can continue my studies over there.

Upon this \\ndiscovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of \\nkin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out \\nby us for the funds (US$20,500,000.00) to be released in your favour as \\nthe beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that we have \\nsecured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of deceased \\nbeneficiaries.  \\n\\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual \\nbusiness endeavour by furnishing me with the following; \\n\\n1. Your name and address \\n2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers \\n\\nThese requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the \\nappropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before \\nthe transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with 30% on \\nfinal conclusion of this project, while the rest shall be for us. \\n\\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you, please response immediately.

He\\ndied after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.\\n\\nBefore his death we were both born again Christian. Since his\\ndeath I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my\\nmatrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband\\nwas alive he deposited the sum of $14.5 Million in a bank in\\nEUROPE.

I want a\\nchurch,organization or good person that will use this fund for\\norphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor\\nthat the house of God is maintained.  l took this decision\\nbecause I don\\'t have any child that will inherit this money and\\nmy husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all\\nbecause they are the one that killed my husband in other to have\\nall my late husband properties and I don\\'t want my husband\\'s\\nefforts to be used by unbelievers. I don\\'t want a situation where\\nthis money will be used in an ungodly way.\\n\\nThis is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death\\nhence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in\\nthe bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that \"the lord will\\nfight my case and I shall  hold my peace\". I don\\'t need any\\ntelephone communication in this regard because of my health hence\\nthe presence of my husband\\'s relatives around me always.\\n\\nI don\\'t want them to know about this development. With God all\\nthings are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give\\nyou the contact of the Bank in EUROPE. I will also issue you an\\nauthority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of\\nthis fund. I want you and the church or the organization to\\nalways pray for me because the lord is my shephard.\\n\\nMy happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.Whoever\\nthat Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth.\\nPlease always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me on\\nthe this email address and any delay in your reply will give me\\nroom in sourcing another church,organization or good person for\\nthis same purpose.

In fact, a lot of \\npeople were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was \\none of the victim.\\n\\nIt is against this background that, I and my family who are currently \\nstaying in South Africa decided to transfer my father?s money to foreign \\naccount since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to \\nopen any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction \\nthroughout the teritorial zone South Africa. As the eldest son of my father, \\nI am saddle with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account \\nwhere this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government \\nwho are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government \\nseems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of \\ninvesting this amount of money in South Africa for fear of going through the \\nsame experience in future since both countries have similar political \\nhistory. Moreover, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow \\nsuch investment for an asylum seeker.\\n\\nAs a businessman, who I have to entrust my future and of my family in his \\nhands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free.  If you \\naccept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to make \\narrangements and come to Johannesburg ? South Africa, so that you can open a \\nnon-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any \\naccount you will nominate overseas.  This money I intend to use for \\ninvestment.\\n\\nI have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain \\npercentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.Or \\nyou can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of \\nthe money in your country.  Whichever the options you want, feel free to \\nnotify me I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses \\nincurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a \\npartnership I am willing to\\ngive you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% will be for my investment \\nin your country.\\n\\nContact me with the above E-mail while I implore you to maintain the \\nabsolute secrect required in this transaction.\\nYours Faithfully,\\nMARK ANDERSON\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nMake each Search mission a success with MSN Toolbar! \\nhttp://toolbar.msn.co.za?DI=1054&XAPID=2083\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'message': 'Dear Friend,\\nI am Ata Yusuf 24 years of age, from Darfur, Sudan, the only surviving Son of the family of Ibrahim Yusuf who was a civil engineer before his death in May 21, 2004 as a result of the crisis in Darfur, Western Sudan. You can read more about the crisis in Dafur, Sudan by click on this weblink; http://www.savedarfur.org/. This unforgettable incident claimed the lives of my parents while my sisters and I were in school, as such we have been in a refugee camp since the death of our parents before a kind hearted woman took me to London, Uk where I have currently seek asylum. As such I am in great need of help now because I need to move my sisters out of the refugee camp back home in Sudan, to settle down with me here in London. \\n\\nI am writing you now because I need you to help me claim the funds my father deposited in a security and finance company in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He deposited the sum of $3.8million us dollars (three million and eight hundred thousand united states dollars) in this security and finance company which I discovered shortly before leaving my country for Uk. I have the relevant document that will be require for the claim of the funds but my problem now is that I am not in the position to handle such huge amount of money here because of my immigration status. It might interest you to know that I have already establish communication with the security company to claim the funds as the heir of my family, unfortunately that is just all I can do by myself for now. As a result, In a nut shell i need you to help me remit the funds from the security company on my behalf, I am sure it will not take too much of your time because I have everything that will facilitate the quick release of the funds to you.\\n\\nI am counting on you to help me in most sincerity and not to take undue advantage of my present situation as I will be basically entrusting you with these funds. Once you get the funds, you have to send me some money that will be enough for my sisters to arrange for their traveling documents to come over to London to join me. \\n\\nFinally, I will need you to invest the rest funds in a profitable partnership business venture in your country, we will discuss our partnership terms when we arrange to meet after the completion of this transfer.\\n\\nI hope to hear from you soon, my regards to your family.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nAta Yusuf.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills.</P>\\n<P>The Banking law and guide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six and half years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as next of kin to the deceased family. We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect of your assistance in this business, and 70 % would be for me and two of my staff in the business.</P>\\n<P>Thereafter,I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore, to enhance the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the Bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your private, telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me on MY E-MAIL, as soon as you receive this letter. I decided to contact you as you have products of interest in your part of the world where we can invest our own percentage to avoid peoples awareness as we are civil servants.</P>\\n<P>Note that we can conclude this operation within ten banking days.Please keep this very confidential for obvious security reasons. Contact me for more information, all confirmable before you apply if you want. Trusting to hear from you shortly for a detailed information which are confirmable before you can make up your mind to apply.If however,you are not interested,do let me know by return mail too as I will not contact anybody else until I hear<BR>from you.Reach me immediately through my private email<BR>address at:nzamo__ben@myway.com</P>\\n<P><BR>May God be with you.</P>\\n<P>Yours faithfully,<BR>Dr Ben Nzamo</P></td></tr></table>\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.</P>\\n<P>On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor, Mr. Charles Fredrick with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,700,000.00(Twenty Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity.</P>\\n<P>I sent a rountine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:<BR><A href=\"http://www.thestate.com/mld/state/4904572.htm\">www.thestate.com/mld/state/4904572.htm</A> on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL,and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Fredrick did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$20,700,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest isbeing rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (five)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.</P>\\n<P>Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Fredrick so that the fruit of this&nbsp; old man\\'s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple,I will like you to provide immediately your fullname and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.</P>\\n<P>We shall employ the service of two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of ths transaction. </P>\\n<P>If you are interested,please reply immediately via the private email address below,upon your responce,i shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assitance to invest my share in your country. Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me the following,to enable start the process of the fund into your bank&nbsp; account:</P>\\n<P>1. Your full Name and contact address.<BR>2. Your private Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication.</P>\\n<P>Immediately I recieve a mail indicating your interest I shall send you more details.</P>\\n<P>Thanks and Regards,</P>\\n<P>Mr.Eric Madu.</P></td></tr></table>\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I am the Personal Attorney to mrs. Ann Parker, a national of your country,. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On December 8, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mrs. Ann Parker. made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14.6,000,000.00(Fourteen Million, Six Hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply.</P>\\n<P>After a month, I sent a reminder and finally i discovered from her contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Ann Parker. died from a ghastly automobile accident.</P>\\n<P>On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace her next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Ann Parker. did not declare any next of kin or relations in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork in her Bank. This sum of US$14.6,000,000.00 is still sitting in her Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund.</P>\\n<P>Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs. Ann Parker. so that the fruits of this woman\\'s labuor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.<BR>This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your <BR>1.Your full names <BR>2.Contact address<BR>3.Your direct telephone and Fax number<BR>4.Your age<BR>5.Your marital status<BR>Based on the following informaion been provide by you i shall prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.</P>\\n<P>I will drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ administration in your favour for the transfer. I would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mrs. Ann Parker. to travel and claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe which is used by her bank as an offshore payment center to the bank. The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you then 10% for any expensee that may come up. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by me with my position as Attorney guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.</P>\\n<P>Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.</P>\\n<P>Awaiting your urgent reply</P>\\n<P>Thanks and regards.</P>\\n<P>Barr.

More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South\\nAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore\\naccount hence your importance in the whole transaction.\\n\\nThis amount TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLAR ($10.5m)\\nrepresents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my\\nDepartment by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials\\nover-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid\\nto the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said\\namount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic\\nTransfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an\\napplication through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the\\ntransfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you be\\nwilling to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your share\\nof the sum will be 25% of the $10.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation\\nand miscellaneous expenses.

And please remember to treat this\\nas very confidential because, we will not comprehend with any form of\\nexposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once\\nagain that, time is of the essence in this business.\\n\\nI wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nBONGIES ZULU\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nGet news headlines and download FREE stuff - visit MSN South Africa! \\nhttp://www.msn.co.za/\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I am married to Mr. Cletus John who worked with Liberian Embassy in Zambia for nine years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for eleven (11) years without a child and he died after a brief illness that lasted for just four (4) days.</SPAN></P>\\n<P><SPAN style=\"FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier\">Before his death, we were both born- again Christians, since my husband&#8217;s death, I have decided never to re-marry or have a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is against. When my late husband was still alive he deposited the sum of US$10,500,000.00 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) with a Security Company in Europe in my name and this money is still with the Security Company up till this moment. Recently, my doctor notified me that I have less than eight (8) months to live due to my cancer problem but the one that bothers me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to leave this fund in Europe.</SPAN></P>\\n<P><SPAN style=\"FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier\">I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is fully maintained. My Bible tell me that \"Blessed is the hand that gives, I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband&#8217;s relatives are not Christians and I do not want my husband&#8217;s effort to be used by un-believers.</SPAN></P>\\n<P><SPAN style=\"FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier\">I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way, this is the reason I am taking this decision, and moreover I am not afraid of death because I know where I am going.

Telephone communications will be minimal in this regard because of my health and also being fully aware of the presence of my husband&#8217;s relatives and my doctors who are always around me. I do not want them to know about this development for I know that with God all things are Possible.</SPAN></P>\\n<P><SPAN style=\"FONT-SIZE: 11px; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: monospace, courier\">As soon as I receive your reply, I will inform the Security Company in Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment and you will need to go and claim this fund in Europe. I will also issue you an authorization letter that will prove that you are the rightful beneficiary to the fund. I want you and your organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my Strength, Shepherd and my Help. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian and whosoever that wants to serve our Lord must serve him in spirit and in truth.

I am =\\ncontacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country =\\nhas become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private =\\ncompany in that region, as the present political instability in my country =\\n(Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not =\\nconducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just as =\\nreported by the International media.\\n\\nI wouldn't go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this web-site if =\\nyou have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.\\n\\nhttp://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.\\n\\nhtml This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership =\\nof President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more =\\nthan 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have =\\nbeen invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these =\\nperiods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 =\\nwhite farmers were killed, the government didn't stop at this, as just =\\nrecently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms =\\nto black farmers or risk going to prison.\\n\\nHaving lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no =\\nother country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. =\\nTherefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so that I can =\\nestablish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must =\\nre-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the =\\nowner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your =\\ncountry.\\n\\nI have deposited in a Security company all the funds realised from the sales =\\nof my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to =\\nUSD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand United States =\\nDollars). These  funds was packaged in two trunk boxes and declared as =\\nGemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company and not to know =\\nof the exact  content so that they don't steal my money.It is to the =\\nknowledge of you and i that it is money that is in the trunk boxes.The trunk =\\nboxes of us$8.5m have been arranged and securely sealed, crated and then =\\ndeposited with a security company ready for shipment abroad via diplomatic =\\ncourier service so as to make it immune to custom and other bureaucratic =\\nchecks at the ports. \\n\\nThe reason for this is because it is the only way the funds can be =\\ntransferred without any problems.\\nFor now, I stay in U A E because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my =\\nfamily. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon your immediate =\\nresponse, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation =\\nthat will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the =\\nsecurity company.\\n\\n Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% =\\nrisk free and should\\nalso be handled in the most confidential manner.\\n\\nI have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage =\\nof the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper =\\nprofitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you =\\nchoose, feel free to notify me. \\n\\nIf for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you =\\n25% of the money while the  remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for =\\nthe investment in your country.\\n\\nSo based on the above, it is important you communicatewith me. On the event =\\nthat you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my =\\ncontact andexistence of my fund a secret.\\n \\nI also require you to make available to me the following\\n \\n1)Your Complete name.\\n \\n2)Your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me comminicate with =\\nyou easily.\\n \\n Sincerely Yours,\\n\\nHASSAN   GEORGE   .\\n  \\n--4a18597d-f3c5-442c-8a01-ce61efc66310--\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Though, this medium \\n(Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because \\nit still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this \\ncorrespondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.\\n\\nAt first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and \\ntrouble free to both parties.\\n\\nMy name is MR TONY HILL I work as the operational manager in account \\nmanagement section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime \\nbanks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant \\ndomiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million \\ntwo hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet \\ninvestigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago \\nwith his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  \\naccount and no other person knows about this account.\\n\\nI am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner \\nand he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  \\nforeigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c \\nis a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he \\nhas no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no  beneficiary and \\nnobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner \\nwho can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder  which I \\nwill provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation \\nin this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance \\nto the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this \\ndormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.\\n\\nI will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to \\nclaim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide \\nyour safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement  that \\nwill ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to \\nnominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct  \\nphone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in \\nhandling this transaction.\\n\\nAt the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total \\ntransfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any  \\nexpenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The \\nfund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer \\nUSD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you  after the \\nsuccessful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will  \\nhave the remaining balance of USD28,223 Million transferred to your account \\nonly after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any \\ndisappointment from your side.\\n\\nI am looking forward to have a reply from you through my E-mail or you can \\ncall me or fax me.If you want to call my No. dial the way you use to call \\nother countries, do not put South African area code which is 27, because it \\nis a satellite phone which I bourght for this transaction for the security \\nreason because our local land line here is not secured.\\n\\n\\nLet me hear from you.\\nBest Regards,\\nMR.TONY HILL\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nSearch & browse smarter, faster - download MSN Search Toolbar today, it's \\nFREE! http://toolbar.msn.co.za?DI=1054&XAPID=2083\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I was the Permanent Secretary =\\nof Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting =\\nyou is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by =\\nHon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper =\\nHelicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the =\\npossibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon =\\ntogether.\\n Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel =\\nforces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need =\\nto purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 =\\nChopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices =\\nfrom Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for =\\nthe purchases, I was told to prepare a ?contract? for the purchases of the =\\nHelicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting =\\nOfficer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers =\\ndelivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out =\\nand it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further =\\ninvestigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to =\\nthe President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian =\\ncompany to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they =\\nwere not overhauled for selfish financial\\n gains.\\n When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released =\\nstating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State =\\nfor Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence.   =\\nNevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public =\\nservices.\\n PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to =\\nacquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the =\\nprobing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all =\\nmy acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to =\\nwithdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and =\\nconfiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my =\\nclosest aide Mr. Steve Charles to be in charge of my projects.    \\n The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money =\\nthat was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 =\\n(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could =\\nnot lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money =\\nwas packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a German =\\nnational, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded =\\nand well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the =\\ncontent. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current =\\nlocation to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Steve Charles who =\\nis currently in europe to transact this business with you since I want my =\\nidentity to be kept out of the money.\\n What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and =\\nwillingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. =\\nYou are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Steve Charles whom is to =\\nrepresent my interest in this transaction, He is currently in europe. As soon =\\nas you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email =\\naddress: stvchar1@netscape.net .He will let you know the modalities to claim =\\nthe funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will =\\nassist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity =\\nrevealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national =\\ncompanies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with =\\nyour assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of =\\nconfidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the =\\ntrust and confidence that I repose on you. l will render you 25% of this =\\nmoney and 5% will go for other expenses. . You ca\\n n also reach me true Mr Steve Charles\\n As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly =\\nconfirm your telephone and fax number  to Mr. Steve Charles. Bear in mind =\\nthat this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your =\\nresponse.\\n Kind personal regards,\\n DR.

My name is Mr. John Naveed, a merchant \\nfrom Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It \\nhas defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about \\na few months to live, according to medical experts.\\n\\nI have not particularly lived my life so well as a good person, as I never \\nreally cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very \\nrich, I was never Generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused \\non my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all \\nthis, as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or \\nmake all the money in the world.\\n\\nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would \\nlive\\nmy life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me \\nand at the point of death, I have willed and given most of my property and \\nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close \\nfamily friends.\\n\\nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul, so I have decided to \\ngive\\nalms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good \\ndeeds\\nI do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity \\norganizations\\nin the U.A.E, Malaysia and some countries in Africa. Now that my health has \\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do so many things by myself anymore.\\n\\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute \\nthe\\nmoney that I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, \\nthey\\nrefused and selfishly kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust \\nthem anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for \\nthem.\\n\\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of \\neleven\\nmillion dollars $11,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company \\nabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to \\nvarious charity organizations. I have set aside some part of this deposit \\nfor you as compensation for your time and any inconvenience this will cost \\nyou. You can also contact me on mr_johnnaveed@yahoo.co.uk\\n\\nGod be with you.\\nMr. John Naveed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I am \\nbarrister Kofi Kosombo,solicitor at law.I am the personal attorney to Mr  \\nPaul Hamp , a national of your country,who was in contract with shell \\ndevelopment company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife \\nAnd their three Children were involved in  a caraccident along sagbama \\nexpress road.\\n\\nAll occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I \\nhave made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients \\nextended relatives  this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several \\nunsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet, \\nto locate any member of his family  hence I contacted you. I have contacted \\nyou to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security \\ncompany by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security \\ncompany doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on \\nthe day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want \\nthem to know the true content of the consignment.\\n\\nThe security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or \\nhave the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very \\nmoney is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority. \\nSince I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 \\nyears now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the \\ndeceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this \\nconsignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you \\nand me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary \\nlegal documents that can be used to back the claim.\\n\\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. \\nI guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that \\nwill protect you from any breach of the law. I am not imposing this \\ntransaction on you,It is a thing of self  willing ness,so it is either you \\nwrite me back and tell me you are willing and I will know the next step to \\ntake because this fund must be claimed either with your help  or the help of \\nsomebody else. After going through the proposal and under standing it very \\nwell and you are willing to do this transaction with me,get back to me \\nimmediately so that we can start as follows:\\n\\n1)I will send to you the contact of the security company,the deposite code, \\nfor you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing.\\n2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security \\ncompany. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven \\nworking days to achieve our aim.\\n\\nIt is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will \\nbecome one family friends for life as I was with my late client.  Your \\nprivate telephone is also needed in reponse to this proposal for oral \\ndiscussions and better understanding.\\nWhile I wait for your reply.\\n\\nBest Regard\\nKoffi Kosombo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

My\\nlate father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich\\nfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the\\nruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his\\nalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition\\nparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to South\\nAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars\\n($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he\\nknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was\\ndeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much\\ndumourage from the security firm.\\nThis money was earmarked for the purchase of new\\nmachinery and chemicals for the farms and the\\nestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.\\nThis land problem arose when President R. MUGABE\\nintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the\\nWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently\\ncondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the\\ngovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mob\\nactions. I and my family who are currently staying in South\\nAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decided\\nto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the\\nTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher\\ntransfer of the money to a foreign country where we\\ncan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of\\nclaiming/investing this amount of money in South\\nAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience in\\nfuture since both countries have the same political\\nhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law\\ndoes not allow such investment hence I am seeking for\\nan asylum or refugee.\\nI must let you know that this business is 100% risk\\nfree and the nature of your business does not\\nnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us\\nclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family have\\nagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be\\nfor a joint business venture I will be doing with you\\nand another 35% will be for me and my family which we\\nshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%\\nwill be mapped out for all expenses we may incure\\nduring the transaction.\\nTherefor, if you are willing and interested to render\\nthe needed assistance. Please funish me your private\\nphone and Fax number for easy and better communication.\\nRemember that this is highly confidential and the\\nsuccess of this business depends on how secret it is kept.\\nPLEASE KINDLY REPLY TO : temawilliams172@webmail.co.za\\n\\nExpecting your reply soonest.\\nBest Regard.\\n\\nTEMA WILLIAMS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'message': \"Dear Friend,\\n\\nGreetings to you.\\n\\nI wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both \\nof us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to \\nmake fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left \\nwith no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my \\nclient who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that \\nhe and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an \\nEgyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this \\nfrom the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\nWEBSITE.\\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.\\n\\nI am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to \\nthe government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years \\nof the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is \\nto seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the \\nlegacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his \\nnext-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great \\nconfidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you \\nand 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami \\nvictims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a \\ncodicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for \\nyou to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.\\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of \\ngetting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity \\nso as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of \\nthe oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the \\nsensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its \\nconfidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with \\nanybody, even if you decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nStephen Ayling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'message': \"Dear Friend,\\n\\nGreetings to you.\\n\\nI wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both \\nof us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to \\nmake fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left \\nwith no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my \\nclient who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that \\nhe and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an \\nEgyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this \\nfrom the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.\\n\\nWEBSITE.\\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.\\n\\nI am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.\\nAccording to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to \\nthe government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years \\nof the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is \\nto seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the \\nlegacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his \\nnext-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great \\nconfidence in me.\\n\\nEverything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you \\nand 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami \\nvictims,\\nas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a \\ncodicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.\\n\\nAgain, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for \\nyou to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.\\nThis is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of \\ngetting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity \\nso as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of \\nthe oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the \\nsensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its \\nconfidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with \\nanybody, even if you decline my request.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\\n\\nYours truly\\n\\nStephen Ayling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I am =\\nMr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable =\\nbank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, =\\nbelieving that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to =\\nyou.\\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =\\nNovember 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON =\\nPETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 =\\ncalendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred =\\nThousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer =\\nbefore I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as =\\nhis account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him =\\non the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding =\\naddress but the letter was returned undelivered. \\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =\\nand finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum =\\nCorporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =\\nof Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his =\\ncountry Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On =\\nfurther investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser? family wife and two =\\nsons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not =\\ndeclare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including =\\nhis Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. \\nThis sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/ =\\nunserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the =\\nowner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have =\\nmade so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that =\\nhave the information.\\n With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =\\nsupport the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By =\\nend of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =\\nwill give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =\\n$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =\\nterrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country =\\nimmediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =\\nmoney, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =\\nof the money. \\n I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner =\\nand that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer =\\nto late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =\\nHead of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of =\\nthe funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =\\nwith the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. =\\nAll documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =\\nthere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =\\na legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =\\nU. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\n If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =\\nthe funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are =\\ninterested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =\\nthe details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat =\\nwith utmost confidentiality. \\n I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when =\\nthe deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent reply through my =\\nprivate email address: ateeq_khan001@yahoo.com\\nRegards, \\nMr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN  \\n--99e82e7e-97e3-4fc9-859d-02ef5ab892e1--\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

He died in the ill-fated Executive Air Services EAS aircraft that =\\ncrashed at the Heipan airport near Jos, the Plateau state capital. My late =\\nhusband was close to the then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the =\\nFederal Republic of Nigeria and he enjoys regular largesse from the Head of =\\nState as the Military Administrator of Kano State where the president came =\\nfrom.\\n\\nRegularly, my late husband bags these largesse in local and foreign =\\ncurrencies to his village (Wase) where they are stored in big trunk boxes in =\\nhis father Emir's palace.  These funds were so staggering that the Emir, my =\\nlate husband's father advised him to make silos for the funds. 12 large =\\noverhead water tanks were made in the premises of the Emir's Palace and all =\\nthe funds were transferred and stored there. The funds in the silos were top =\\nsecret between my late husband and his father whom he deceived into believing =\\nthat the money belong to General Sani Abacha, the then Head of State.  \\n\\nAfter my late husband's death in the ill-fated air craft on 7th January, 1997 =\\nleaving his large fortune unprotected. The head of State General Sani Abacha =\\npaid a condolence visit to the Emir, my late husband's father, the old man =\\nbelieving that the fund in the silos belongs to the head of state and knowing =\\nhow brutal he was at that time informed the head of state of the money his =\\nson has been keeping for him. He thanked the old man and ordered the money to =\\nbe moved to Aso Rock - Abuja (Government House at the Federal Capital =\\nTerritory). The money was removed with special army bullion vans in the most =\\nbizarre manner that nothing was left for us (the family) to inherit. To us on =\\nthat day, it was like another river has emptied its water into the ocean.  =\\nOur problems (me and my children) started from that day.\\n\\nI have just been informed by my late husband's attorney, our family attorney =\\nBarrister I.K. Saggay, Principal Partner - Casefile & Co. that my late =\\nhusband operated secret domiciliary account with fictitious name in one of =\\nthe commercial banks and all the funds amounting to has been credited in his =\\nfavour and I the widow was nominated as the next of kin as stated in his WILL =\\nand last testament. He has now instructed me to seek in confidence a foreign =\\npartner who will assist me in transferring the funds abroad to secure the =\\nfuture and education of my children. The attorney has said that the =\\nconditional is very favourable for the fund to be transferred.\\n\\nIn the light of the above, I would like you to contact me if you are =\\ninterested in this project so that I can direct you to our family attorney =\\nwho will furnish you with further details and the modalities on how the fund =\\ncan be wired to your bank account. You will be at liberty to negotiate a =\\ncommission for your assistance with our family attorney.

       "  'message': 'Greetings!!!\\n\\nI am Mr Martins  Imaa  Lucas, a member of staff in a Corporate Securities \\nfirm. We keep valuables for high net worth individuals, blue chip \\ncorporations and diplomatic organisations.\\n\\nI am contacting you in regards to our client, the late Chief (Mrs.) Stella \\nObasanjo, who died on Sunday October 23, 2005 in a surgical operation in \\nSpain. This client has a total deposit of Thirty Two Million United States \\nDollars in our vaults. After the 9/11 incidents, our company policy do not \\npermit cash deposit, so he confided in me as the foreign operations officer \\nto make this deposit since June 2004. She did this to avoid traces f the \\nmoney to her since her husband, president Olusegun Obansanjo was against any \\ncorruption and embezzlement of funds.\\n\\nThe last communication I had with her was on the 25th of August 2005, where \\nshe was making arrangements to claim the deposit. Thereafter it was revealed \\nthat she died of a surgical operation in Spain in October.  After the \\nacknowledgement of her death, it became apparent that there was no claim to \\nher funds since she listed no next of kin in her bio-data form. She made the \\ndeposit under the name of Guardian Trust investment (GTI) and disclosed the \\ncontent as company valuables and Antiques. This was for confidentiality and \\nto reduce taxes.\\n\\nIf no claim is made within six months, the company under its storage terms \\nand conditions will legally auction the content of the deposit. If \\ndiscovered that the content is cash, it will be confiscated and I would be \\npenalised, since I accepted the cash deposit against the company’s \\nregulations. As a staff, it is impossible for me to have access to the funds \\nor claim it myself. More so, such valuable deposits are kept at a different \\nbranch, where we have our terminal facilities. Consequently, it is important \\nthat I find a credible candidate to play the role of the Trustee or \\nrepresentative of Guardian Trust investment to help claim the deposit.  It \\nis on this ground that I need your assistance to claim the funds which will \\nbe possible with the information I hold. Once this is achieved, you shall be \\nentitled to 50% of the total funds while I shall retain the balance 50%.\\n\\nI am aware of the risks involved in this proposal, therefore I ask that you \\nconsider the factors above and keep it strictly confidential. However, if \\nyou feel you are unable to\\nfulfil this role, I request you discard of this letter.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing form you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nMr Martins  Imaa  Lucas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Usman Wase, son of the =\\nEmir of Wase, Plateau State, Nigeria. My late husband was the Military =\\nAdministractor of Kano State during the reign of the late General Sani =\\nAbacha. He died in the ill-fated Executive Air Services EAS aircraft that =\\ncrashed at the Heipan airport near Jos, the Plateau state capital. My late =\\nhusband was close to the then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the =\\nFederal Republic of Nigeria and he enjoys regular largesse from the Head of =\\nState as the Military Administrator of Kano State where the president came =\\nfrom.\\n\\nRegularly, my late husband bags these largesse in local and foreign =\\ncurrencies to his village (Wase) where they are stored in big trunk boxes in =\\nhis father Emir's palace.  These funds were so staggering that the Emir, my =\\nlate husband's father advised him to make silos for the funds. 12 large =\\noverhead water tanks were made in the premises of the Emir's Palace and all =\\nthe funds were transferred and stored there. The funds in the silos were top =\\nsecret between my late husband and his father whom he deceived into believing =\\nthat the money belong to General Sani Abacha, the then Head of State.  \\n\\nAfter my late husband's death in the ill-fated air craft on 7th January, 1997 =\\nleaving his large fortune unprotected. The head of State General Sani Abacha =\\npaid a condolence visit to the Emir, my late husband's father, the old man =\\nbelieving that the fund in the silos belongs to the head of state and knowing =\\nhow brutal he was at that time informed the head of state of the money his =\\nson has been keeping for him. He thanked the old man and ordered the money to =\\nbe moved to Aso Rock - Abuja (Government House at the Federal Capital =\\nTerritory). The money was removed with special army bullion vans in the most =\\nbizarre manner that nothing was left for us (the family) to inherit. To us on =\\nthat day, it was like another river has emptied its water into the ocean.  =\\nOur problems (me and my children) started from that day.\\n\\nI have just been informed by my late husband's attorney, our family attorney =\\nBarrister I.K. Saggay, Principal Partner - Casefile & Co. that my late =\\nhusband operated secret domiciliary account with fictitious name in one of =\\nthe commercial banks and all the funds amounting to US$4.5 million has been =\\ncredited in his favour and I the widow was nominated as the next of kin as =\\nstated in his WILL and last testament. He has now instructed me to seek in =\\nconfidence a foreign partner who will assist me in transferring the funds =\\nabroad to secure the future and education of my children.\\n\\nIn the light of the above, I would like you to contact me if you are =\\ninterested in this project so that I can direct you to our family attorney =\\nwho will furnish you with further details and the modalities on how the fund =\\ncan be wired to your bank account. You will be at liberty to negotiate a =\\ncommission for your assistance with our family attorney.

A. E. I write you this proposal in \\ngood faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to =\\nreveal to you.\\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =\\nNovember 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the \\nCHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) =\\nfor 36 calendar months, valued at \\nUS$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my =\\nbank and I happen to be his account officer before I was \\nmoved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account =\\nofficer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on \\nthe maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address =\\nbut the letter was returned undelivered. \\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =\\nand finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum \\nCorporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =\\nof Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to \\nhis country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. \\n=\\n\\nOn further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =\\ntwo sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he \\ndid not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, =\\nincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any \\nWILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =\\ndormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no \\none have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the =\\ninvestigation I have made so far, my bank management is not \\naware of it, I am the only one that have the information.\\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =\\nsupport the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. \\nBy end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law =\\nwhich will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of \\nabove $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not =\\nfor terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country \\nimmediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =\\nmoney, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain \\nthe source of the money. \\nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =\\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to \\n=\\n\\nlate Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =\\nHead of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of \\nthe funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =\\nwith the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. \\n=\\n\\nAll documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =\\nthere is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =\\n\\na legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =\\nU. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =\\nthe funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are \\ninterested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =\\nthe details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. \\nPlease, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the =\\ndeposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your =\\nperusal. \\nI wait your urgent reply through my private email address: =\\narahkhrahman@yahoo.com.au\\nRegards, \\nMr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.   \\n--e6ddbe62-47f1-44f3-a133-a38409aca222--\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I am Ali =\\nRaza Khan currently Head of Corporate Affairs Department with a reputable =\\nbank here in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing =\\nthat I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June =\\n5th, 2000, a German  business tycoon Mr. Andreas Schranner made a (Fixed =\\ndeposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen =\\nMillion Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen  to be =\\nhis account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. The =\\nmaturity date for this deposit contract was last 3rd of April 2005.  Before =\\nthis date, I have tried my possible best to locate a Next of Kin to late Mr. =\\nSchranner, but all efforts prooved abortive, because all his family, =\\nincluding his Son In-Law and children died in the plane crash of Concorde Air =\\nFrance Flight AF4590 which took place on 25th July 2000, some months after he =\\ndid the deposit in my bank.  You can read more stories about the plane crash =\\nby visiting this website, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm\\n\\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =\\nsupport the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By =\\nend of October this year, the Government will pass a new Financial Control =\\nLaw which will give the Government authority to interrogate account owners of =\\nabove $5 million Dollars to explain the source of the funds, making sure it =\\nis not for terrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country =\\nimmediately, by October the Government will definitely confiscate the money, =\\nbecause my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the =\\nmoney since he is late.  \\n\\nI decided to utilize this life time opportunity, instead of Government =\\nconfiscating the, but I cannot directly claim the money without the help of a =\\nforeigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the =\\nAccount Officer to late Mr. Schranner, coupled with my present position and =\\nstatus in the bank, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to =\\nany foreigner that comes up as the Next of Kin to the account, with the =\\ncorrect information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  I am =\\nhaving the secret Code for the account, which only the account owner of his =\\nNext of Kin can know.  \\n\\nI shall supply all necessary information we need for the claim and there is =\\npractically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a =\\nlegitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =\\nU. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =\\nthe funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  I shall =\\nexplain to you in details how we shall handle the transaction once I receive =\\nyour response.  \\n\\nThanking you in advance and May God blesses you. Please, treat with utmost =\\nconfidentiality.  I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to =\\nMr. Schranner when the deposit was made for your perusal.   \\n\\nI wait your urgent response.  \\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nAli Raza Khan.  \\n  \\n--451eb171-5830-4e19-b191-5cfa09b077dd--\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I am WILLIAM ZUNGU , the son of Dr. ZUNGU who was recently \\nmurdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through your \\ncountry’s Information Exchange in my search for a reliable and reputable \\nperson to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves a transfer \\nof fund into a foreign account and I decided to write to you. The war \\nveterans of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe for their \\nalleged support murdered my late father among the few black Zimbabwean rich \\nfarmers in cold blood for the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), which is \\nagainst Mugabe’s rule.\\n\\nThe land problem arose when Mugabe introduced a New Land Act that wholly \\naffected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned the “ \\nmodus operadi” adopted by the government.\\n\\nThis resulted to rampart killings and mob action by the war veterans and \\nthugs. More than 78 people have so far been killed. Heads of Government from \\nthe West, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their \\ncondemnation of Mugabe’s Land Act. Subsequently, South Africa Development \\nCommunity (SADC) has continuously supported Mugabe. It is against this \\nbackground that my family and I who are currently in South Africa have \\ndecided to transfer this money out of Africa as we no longer feel safe \\nanymore and want to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can \\nestablish ourselves.\\n\\nJust before my father’s death, he took me to Johannesburg, South Africa to \\ndeposit the sum of US$30.0000.00 (THIRTY MILION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with a \\nsecurity and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. \\nThis money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from \\nthe finance company. This amount was embarking for the purchase of new farms \\nmachinery and chemicals, as well as the establishment of some new farms in \\nLesotho and Swaziland.\\n\\nAs the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of \\nseeking for genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred \\ninto without knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our \\nfamily’s wealth and the South African government seems to be playing along. \\nI am faced with the dilemma of investing the money here since both countries \\nhave almost the same history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange \\ndoes not allow such investments as I am seeking for asylum.\\n\\nAs a businessperson whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family, \\nI must let you know that there is no risk and the nature of your business \\ndoes not necessarily matter. Therefore, should you be able and willing to \\nhelp me and my family, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for \\nyour assistance, 10% will be set aside for expenses we may incur while the \\nrest 60% will be for my family. It is our wish to invest our money on \\ncommercial property based on your advice and I will also receive assurance \\nthat you would not sit on this money when transferred into your account.\\n\\nIf this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via my \\nEMAIL.please i want you to include your private telephone number for easy \\ncommunication.\\n\\n\\nBest regards,\\nWilliam\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nHave a video conversation in real time - Get MSN Messenger - FREE download. \\nhttp://messenger.msn.co.za?DI=1054&XAPID=2532\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

ARBU  MPULA.\\nSOUTH AFRICA JOHANNESBURG.\\nTEL:27-73-2390-447.\\n\\n\\nATTN: M/D CEO/ GOKER ,\\n\\n\\n\\nPLEASE WE  NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don\\'t know me \\npersonally. I am Mr,    Arbu  Mpula, the son of Dr.Henry  Mpula, who was \\nrecently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.\\nI got your contact through South African Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) in \\nJohannesburg, and I decided to solicit for your assistance. My late father \\nwas among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold  blood by \\nthe agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his \\nalleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled \\nby the white minority. Before his death he had taken me to  Johannesburg- \\nSouth Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 23.Million(Twenty three Million  \\nUnited States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he Foresaw \\nthe looming danger in Zimbabwe.\\nThe money was deposited in a metal box and declared as a personal effects \\nfor the use of some of his friends who were to arrive for the world \\nconference on racism scheduled to hold in South Africa from fromr 1st  \\nmarch, 2003.This money was given to my father by President.Robert Mugabe \\nhimself, for investment in South Africa when they were in good terms. The \\ndispute between my father and the President arose when the President \\nintroduced a new land reform-act, which adversely affected the rich white \\nfarmers and so  black farmers as well.    My father was vehemently opposed \\nto the \"modus operandis\"adopted by the government and publicly oppose it. \\nThis brought him in direct conflict with the president. To achieve his \\npurpose, the president used war veterans to plunder, loot and occupy all \\nfarms belonging to the white farmers and their black sympathizers. More than \\nFifty Farmers has lost their lives so far. Heads of governments from the \\nwest, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced there \\ncondemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development \\nCommunity (S.A.D.C) has continuously Supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it is \\nagainst this background that I and my family who are currently Residing in \\nSouth Africa have decided to transfer my Father\\'s money into a foreign \\naccount. As the eldest Son of my Father, I am saddled with the \\nresponsibility Of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money Could \\nbe transferred without the knowledge of my Government who are tactically \\nfreezing our family Wealth and South Africa\\'s government seems to be Playing \\nalong with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in \\nSouth Africa for fear of Encountering the same experience in future  since \\nboth Countries have almost the same political history.\\n\\nso, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment \\nhence I am seeking for an \"assylum\". As a businessperson that I entrusted my \\nFuture and that of my family into his hands, I must  Let you know that this \\ntransaction is 100% risk Free and the nature of your business does not \\nnecessarily matter. For your assistance, we are offering You 20% of the \\ntotal sum, 75% for me and my family While 5%  will be mapped out for any \\nexpenses we may incurs during this transaction. We wish to invest our Money \\non commercial property based on your advice. Finally will demand for \\nassurance that you will not  sit on this money when it finally gets to your \\npersonal or company\\'s account in your country.  If this proposal is \\nacceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above telephone, or \\nyou reply  through email.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    THANKS  AND  GOD  BLESS  YOU,\\n\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nMr; Arbu  Mpula,\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nDon\\'t just search.

I instructed them specifically not to send the funds <BR>to Russia because of the problems, but that the funds to be deposited <BR>with a Finance and Security company in Europe on hold. A huge cash <BR>deposit of Twenty-Five Million dollars was domiciled with a finance/Security <BR>Company overseas to my knowledge only.

I am =\\nMr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank =\\nhere in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I =\\ncan trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\\n \\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =\\nNovember 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign  Oil consultant/contractor with the =\\nCHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. jack farrer powell  made a (Fixed deposit) =\\nfor 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five =\\nhundred Thousand Dollars only) in my \\nbank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present =\\nposition recently. Upon maturity in 2003,as his account officer and as well =\\nthe bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a =\\nroutine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned =\\nundelivered. \\n \\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter,but it was again returned and =\\nfinally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum =\\nCorporation that Mr.jack farrer powell  died as a result of torture in the =\\nhand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to =\\nhis country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =\\nOn further investigation, I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell  family =\\nwife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he =\\ndid not declare any next of kin or relation in all his \\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did =\\nnot leave any WILL.This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed =\\nunder dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have =\\nheard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the =\\ninvestigation I have made so far, my bank \\nmanagement is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.\\n \\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =\\nsupport the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By =\\nend of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =\\nwill give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =\\n$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =\\nterrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country =\\nimmediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =\\nmoney, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =\\nof the money.  \\n \\nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =\\nthat is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to =\\nlate jack farrer powell , coupled with my present position and status in the =\\nbank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have the power to influence the =\\nrelease of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the =\\naccount, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall =\\ngive you.  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully =\\nworked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be =\\nexecuted under a legitimate arrangement that \\nwill protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and =\\nanything goes.\\n \\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =\\nthe funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are =\\ninterested, contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over =\\nthe details.  \\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost =\\nconfidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account =\\nissued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.  I wait your =\\nurgent response soon. \\n  \\n \\nRegards,     \\nMr. Ali Raza Khan.  \\n--199ed852-c25f-440b-896c-bc34014df349--\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'message': \"Dear\\nI salute you in the name of the most High! My name is Mrs. Rose Ameeraly.\\n\\nAm a widow and a mother of two girls. We do not know each other and I'm wondering how you will view this letter. Please, accept my sincere apology. Sorry, about taking your time as well. I will be highly obliged if you can assist me in this business. My Husband is an Nigerian while I am a Ghanaian. My late husband, David Ameeraly, was a loving, caring and hardworking businessman. Prior to his death by plane crash, he was living with us in Accra, Ghana. He died November 1st 1990. This sad event occurred during one of his business trips to the US. Please, find below the website for more information. If you go through this publication critically, you will find my husband's name, David Ameeraly amongst others that lost their life on that fateful day as published by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stmB\\nBefore the sudden death of my beloved husband, he planned to establish a business in Europe with the sum of US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). Unfortunately, he died before this venture could materialize. Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his properties (assets and money).\\n\\nSince I am a woman and my offsprings are all girls coupled with the fact that I do not have a male child, I was put under terrible pressure to stay clear from my legitimate husband estates According to their family culture/traditional believe, a woman is not allowed to run late\\nhusband business and worst of all, I was asked to move into David's younger brother's household as one of his wives. My problem started when I refused to be inherited by David's younger brother. Fortunately,  the proposed investment fund US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). that was deposited with the investment/security company was unknown to the family. As such, they did not ask for this. If not, it would have been a problem as there would have been nothing to fall back on. It's only our lawyer & my humble self that know of this fund. I have discussed this matter with the Finance company were the fund was lodged. This is the asset I have left and I need part of this money for my daughters school fees and to maintain my personal life as well. David's family was vehemently against my daughters education. All they intend doing,\\nwas to give them out for marriage at a tender age. According to the staff of the finance company, the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money into an alternative bank account for safekeeping.\\n\\nLater it will be used for business investment which is subject to the advise of whoever that will be assisting us finally.\\nFor obvious reasons, I do not want the finance company's involvement.\\nThis transaction must be handled under strict confidentiality. At this juncture, I thought it wise to solicit your indispensable assistance to receiving this fund on my behalf. I do not have knowledge of funds management & business in general. I was a full-time housewife.\\nTherefore, this step depends on your trust-worthiness & ability to handle funds of this magnitude. All that is required of you, is to forward to me by email, your direct phone, fax, address or any other information you may deem helpful. I need the requested information for the purpose of securing the relevant documents in your name as my confidante/ bona fide beneficiary. Please, note that this transaction is legitimate and 100% hitch-free. We will not violate any known law of my country and that of yours. So, be rest-assured.\\nHowever, as soon as I receive your positive response to the above business transaction, I shall provide you with necessary transfer details. Note also, that you must convince me of your trust-worthiness and ability to keep secret. I have decided to compensate you with 30%\\nof the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 70% will be used to pursue my late husband's investment dream in real estate.\\nThanking you for your anticipated response as I look forward to hearing\\nfrom you.\\nI remain.\\nSincerely yours,\\nMrs.Rose David Ameeraly\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .</P>\\n<P><BR>During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.</P>\\n<P><BR>The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.</P>\\n<P><BR>In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.

Castro, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Capital trust bank Benin, Cotonou, Republic of Benin West Africa, and also a special account officer of Mr. Peter Lund,European. He was a seasoned contractor with Benin Cement Company, Cotonou, who unfortunately died in a plane crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on 25th December, 2003.You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this website:\\n \\n1.www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-3555201,00.html\\n2.www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/\\n\\nBefore his death on the 25th December 2003, Mr.Lund has a fixed deposit account with the bank and no other person know about this account or have any information relating to this account. The account has no beneficiary nor next-of-kin other than him, My investigation reveal that his supposed next-of-kin died along with him in the crash. Since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.\\n\\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you.I'm contacting you to assist in remittance of a dormant fund as the next of kin left behind by Mr.Lund so as not to allow the bank confiscate or declare the funds unserviceable in the account according to Benin Republic financial law on unclaimed bills which the government usually map out for the purchase of ammunitions which are the major course of conflicts in the west of  Africa. Consequently, I'm seeking your consent to present you as the next-of-kin to the deceased customer so that the outstanding fixed deposit (US$24.1M) will be remitted into any designated account of yours to be shared by both of us in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% for you.\\n\\nI have all necessary legal documents to back up this claim. All that is required of you is absolute honesty, total commitment, co-operation & absolute confidentiality. Be rest-assured that this transaction will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect both parties from breach of the law and it is 100% risk free and attracts no authorities and every information you will require as the next of kin will be forwarded to you after your final acceptance to help me champion this deal. If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email your following information to me.\\n\\na. Full Name(s)\\n\\nb. Direct phone & fax number(s)\\n\\nc. Your personal email and your complete home address.\\n\\nThank you for your cooperation until I read from you. You may also reach me at my private mailbox and call me for further information on +229 97  89 18 35\\nmr_johncastro@yahoo.fr\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nMr. John Castro\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I got your email during a Personal research on =\\nthe Internet and wish to use this opportunity to notify you of the existence =\\nof a certain amount we wish to transfer Overseas for the purpose of =\\ninvestments and importation of goods from your country. \\nIn May 2003, a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars =\\n($66,000,000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry.

With the Consent of only the head of the =\\ncontract evaluation department, I over Invoiced the contract value by thirty =\\nfour million \\nUnited States dollars ($34,000,000:00). \\nThe contract has since been completed and the foreign company fully paid off. =\\nBut, in the office files and paper work, the company is still owed USD34M =\\nrepresenting the over invoiced amount. Because this amount is derived from =\\nthe award and execution of a foreign contract, there is no way the money can =\\nbe paid locally. That is why I am contacting you so that we can do the =\\nproject together for our mutual benefit. We have concluded every necessary =\\narrangement to transfer this amount to a foreign account as the final phase =\\npayment for the said contract. \\nI solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your =\\nsafe bank account and after we shall come over there to share the money with =\\nyou. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new =\\nbank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve =\\nto receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end =\\nof this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never =\\nlet me down either now or in future.\\n \\nWe sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share the =\\nmoney in the following percentages, 65% will be for us, 30% will be for you =\\nwhose account is used to secure the funds and 5% will be used to settle every =\\nexpenses incurred during the transaction like air tickets etc. There is no =\\nrisk involvement because applications will be made to the concerned Federal =\\nministries and parastatals with official approvals given by the Federal =\\ngovernment before the Central bank of Nigeria will be officially authorized =\\nto wire the funds to your nominated bank account by telegraphic transfer. =\\nThose involved over here are directors in the ministry, they know how best to =\\neffect the transfer and will come over there to collect their own share. \\nIf you are interested, contact me via email indicating your full =\\nnames,company/business name and address. Your direct telephone and fax =\\nnumbers for effective communication.
