CHIEF DANIEL ELEME, PHD, EZE 1 OF ELEME.E-MAIL 
ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  

ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 
This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the chambers of commerce and industry of your country on the net, you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 
However, I am the first son of His Royal majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of Eleme Province in the oil producing area of RiverState of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracteddiabetes.But before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary status. The lodgment security code number was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for areliable business partner abroad, that will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and particulars to any Country of your choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due.  But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss physically on investment potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not drug money and it is not money from arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this matter. I will give more details about the proceedings of this transaction as soon as I receive your favorable reply. Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. 

I am waiting for your quick response. 

Yours faithfully, 

Prince Obong Abbot

Dear Sir,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

Dear,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie(me and you) I am also believing that you will not expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about to establish with you. I have decided to contact you with greatest delight and personal respect.

I am Mr Benard Gelicah Sankoh Son to FODAY SANKOH who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone. Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$22 million dollars cash (TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS).
This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my father and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family.

Thereafter, I contacted the security company and notify them with the two documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money immediately for investment .

Based on this, I solicited for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be transferred to in your country or another nearby country where
taxation will not take great toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I
will like you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you. For
your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to offer you 15% percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business.
The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I would like you to keep this business very confidential. Upon the
receipt of your mail

I shall expect your urgent reply. 

Thank you and God bless you

Mr Benard Gelicah Sankoh.

RE:  TRANSFER OF ($26,000.000.00 USD}
        TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas account
($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Prime 
Bank here in South Africa, I want to ask you, If you are not capable to 
quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a 
new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve 
to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing 
in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Jeffery Hill the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in 
South Africa, during the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund 
in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and since 1998 nobody has operated 
on this account again,after going through some old files in the records I 
discovered that the owner of the account died without a
[Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out 
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is 
PEDRO F. HASLER a foreigner,a great industrialist and he died
since 1998.No other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation 
proved to me as well that until his death he was the manager GOLD ARK [pty]. 
SA.

We will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000] upon 
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount to your account.

The total amount involve is Twenty six million United States Dollars only 
[$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million United 
States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before 
the rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a 
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, 
without valid international foreign
passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international 
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US 
dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner too,and the money can 
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together when we meet 
face to face after the first transfer of $6 Million before transferring the 
second part of $20 Million. I am revealing this to you with believe in God 
that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the 
only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently 
so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your 
private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account 
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will bind us together immediately after the first transfer 
before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet 
up with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me 
in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will
never, never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer 
this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official
Will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money 
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can call me for 
heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know 
that this business is confidential.I will use my position and influence to 
obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant 
ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.

Yours truly,
Jeffery Hill.

       {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
{ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.JOHN CHOMA,the Auditor General of a bank
in Africa, during the course of our auditing  I
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993.
and  no other person knows about this account or any
thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager
Morris & Morris Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account,

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip
Morris is a foreigner too, [and the money can only
be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address  from the Girl

to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you,to transfer to your 
overseas account,sum of,(US$10.500.000m)Ten million five hundred thousands 
United States Dollars) from one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal,I 
urgently want to know soonest you,If you are not capable to handle and 
acomodate this magnitude of funds untill i resign and come over to join for 
an investment in your country,tell me so that i can quietly look for another 
reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit 
enough to provide either an existing bank account
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this funds,even an empty

I am Mr Mona Noah the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in 
Dakar Senegal west Africa during the course of our auditing,I discovered a 
floating fund in an account opened in the our bank
since 1982 and till date no body has operated on this account again,after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of 
the account died long ago in a plane crash along with his
family without leaving a[Heir/WILL] hence the funds is floating and if I do 
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner 
of this account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreigner
before his death,he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No

account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.

Since I hardly know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as a foreigner 
partner to stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be 
approved to a local person here as his next of kin,without valid 
international foreign passport,but can only be approved to any foreigner

too,and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct

business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Nelson Abia, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again. After going through some old files
in the records, I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a
foreigner, and a sailor. He died since 1993
and  no other person knows about this account or any
thing concerning it. The account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager 
Morris Coy.(pty). SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [26,000,000.00] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  amount
to your account.

The amount involved is (76M USD ) Siventy Six million United States Dollars, I want to first transfer $26,000,000.00 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollars] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner. I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to
a local person here without a valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c, Mr. Phillip Morris was a foreigner too, [and the money can only
be approved into a foreign a/c].

However, we will sign a binding agreement to bind us
together. I got your contact address  from the girl
who operates computer. I am revealing this to you
with belief in God that you will never let me down in
this business. You are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take . Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will bind us
together before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Then,
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money, leaving no trace to any place.
To build confidence, you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face, after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.


Sincerely,


Mr Nelson Abia.

his next of kin to come up and claim his money=2E Unfortunately
from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his 
relation or friends has come up for the claim=2E The banking and financial

fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill=2E That is
 why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my
retirement=2E

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by
 the fact that the customer Mr=2E Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a

Dear Sir, 




I am DR KABO HAMMED




I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil
consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered
time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five
hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity,
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract 
employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident 
with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On 
further investigation, I found out that he did not 
leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin 
were fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered 
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n
all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still
sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim
the funds. 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry
Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me
immediately with your full names and address so that
the attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the
next of kin.
 
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you
with more details and relevant documents that will
help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country. 
Awaiting your urgent reply via email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com


Thanks and regards

Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, during the course of our
auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened
in the bank in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account died
without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Reed H.Huish, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that Reed H.Huish until
his death was the Reed H.Huish Coy.(pty). SA. 

We will start the first transfer with Thirty four million
[$34,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any
disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount of($ 100,000.000.00
USD) to your account.

The amount involved is ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One hundred
and thirty four million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $34,000.000.00 [thirty four million
United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know
any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money can not be approved to a local person
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can
only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the
money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.
Reed H.Huish is a foreigner too, and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address from the Girl who
operates computer, I am revealing this to you with believe
in God that you will never let me down in this business,
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your
private telephone and fax number including the full details
of the account to be used for the deposit.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine.Because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of
this account,which I will give to you, upon your positive
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and
will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is
deeply involved with me in this business. I need your
strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we
can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable
account, which you can provide with assurance that this
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your
country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all
documents of transaction immediately we receive this money
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you
can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your country at least two days
ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I
hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this
fund in your account. I will use my position and influence
to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from the
relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35%
of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be
for expenses both parties might have incurred during the
process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply to phone and fax

They have even closed all my husband bank accountsjust to put me and my beloved children into suffery and starvation=2E Now I urgently need an assistance of a reputable and trustworthy Foreigner like you to help me receive and subsequently invest on my children=92s behalf the sum of US$ 10=2E000=2E000=2E00 =28TEN MILLION DOLLARS=29=2C which my husband kept in a vault before his death=2E It therefore became very necessary and urgent that somebody in your foreign position should render a helping hand to safe-guard this fund for me in safe haven over there until my arrival in your country=2E

ATTN: Sir/Madam,

I know that this message will come to you as a surprise
since we don?t know each other, but for purpose of
introduction, I am DAVID MORGAN. The bank manager of
AMALGAMATED BANK OF South Africa (ABSA). There is an
account opened in this bank in 1982 and since 1990, nobody
has operated in this account again. After going through
some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do
not remove this money out urgently, it would be forfeited
for nothing. The owner of this account is MR. ADAMS
COLEMAN, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold company, a
geologist by profession and he died since 1990. 

No other person knows about this account or anything
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigations proved to me as well that his company does
not know anything about this account. The amount involved
is US$18m (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS). I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money
cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be
approved to any foreign Account because the money is in US
Dollars and the former owner of the account is MR. ADAMS
COLMEAN is a foreigner too. I know that this message will
come to you as a surprise as we don?t know ourselves
before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is
real and a genuine business. 

Please reply or call me urgently so that I will inform you
the next step to transfer this fund to your resident Bank
Account immediately. Send also your private telephone and
fax numbers including the full details of the account to be
used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or
sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you
can receive this money into a foreign account or any
Account of your choice where this money will be safe. And I
will fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other
investments. 

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I
need your full co-operation to make this work fine because
the management is ready to approve this payment to any
foreigner, who has correct information of this account,
which I will give to you later immediately, if you are
capable and willing to handle such amount in strict
confidence and trust according to my instruction and advice
for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never
come again in my life. I want you to be truthful in this
business, because I don?t want to make mistake, I need your
strong assurance and trust. 

With my position now in the office, I can transfer this
money now to any foreigner?s reliable account, which you
can provide with assurance that this money will be intact
bending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately you

<BR>
Dear Friend,
 I am Mrs.Suha Arafat Yasser from Palestinian. I am married to the late formal head of state of Palestinian for several years before he died in France after a brief illness. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18m (eighteen million U.S.Dollars)with a BANK in London. Presently, I have carefully moved this funds out of the bank in London and deposit it with a private company in Europe as a photo material for family use for safe keeping so that my govern we not know about this funds as they have already seized and freeze all the bank account belonging to my late husband both home and abroad. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can visit the BBC news b
 roadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3995769.stm

It is on this note that I'm asking your partnership to keep this fund to your account. I took this decision because my government is not in good terms with me; I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my government agents around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my lawyer who is base in London Uk to finalize this transaction with you.  
Best Regards, 
Mrs. Suha Arafat Yasser<BR>

        Email Content : Attn: The President/CEO 
I am Mr. Fred Mende, Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
On June 8, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:fredmende4@rediffmail.com

Thanks and regards. 
Mr.Fred Mende.

{URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)

(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 134,000.000.00 USD 
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ) 

Dear,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One
hundred and Thirty four million United States Dollars) from
National Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, I want to ask
you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank
account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive
this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this
money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end
for this important business trusting in you and believing
in God that you will never let me down either now or in
future.

I am MR FRANK DAMAS , the Auditor General in Natinal Credit
Bank (NCB) of South Africa, during the course of our
auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened
in the bank in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account died
without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Reed H.Huish, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that Reed H.Huish until
his death was the Reed H.Huish Coy.(pty). SA. 

We will start the first transfer with Thirty four million
[$34,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any
disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount of($ 100,000.000.00
USD) to your account.

The amount involved is ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One hundred
and thirty four million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $34,000.000.00 [thirty four million
United States Dollar ]from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know
any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money can not be approved to a local person
here, without valid international foreign passport, but can
only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the
money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.
Reed H.Huish is a foreigner too, and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address from the Girl who
operates computer, I am revealing this to you with believe
in God that you will never let me down in this business,
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your
private telephone and fax number including the full details
of the account to be used for the deposit.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine.Because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of
this account,which I will give to you, upon your positive
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and
will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is
deeply involved with me in this business. I need your
strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we
can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable
account, which you can provide with assurance that this
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your
country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all
documents of transaction immediately we receive this money
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you
can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your country at least two days
ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I
hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this
fund in your account. I will use my position and influence
to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from the
relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35%
of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be
for expenses both parties might have incurred during the
process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply to phone and fax
number above or[frankdamas@webmail.co.za]

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the 
marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices 
($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the 
time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 
cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to 
report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of 
line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Jim,

Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Phillip Allen

Jeff,

 I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written 
approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has 
concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like 
to review the closing statements as soon as possible.

Brenda,

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

4.  Check 1415  Papes      Detail description and units?

6.  Check 1428    Ralph's   What unit?

7.  Check 1438    Walmart?    Description and unit?  


Try and pull together the support for these items and get back to me.

Jeff,

 I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I 
am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
 I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out 
when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?

 What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember 
we have to get Brenda happy.

San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500


The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the 
transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan 
and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and 
sold 800 Socal.

Jeff,

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.  

Phillip"

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Phillip"

Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  

 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.


 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Phillip

Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Phillip"

Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel.

Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Phillip"

Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip

can you build something to look at historical prices from where we saved 
curves each night.

Here is an example that pulls socal only.
Improvements could include a drop down menu to choose any curve and a choice 
of index,gd, or our curves.

Wade,

 I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle 
situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the 
tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) 
if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and 
you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your 
income.

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip"

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

data.  Tim H. expressed concern over the reliability of the wscc data.  I 
don't know if we should scrap the wscc or just keep monitoring in case it 
improves.  Let me know what you think.

Lucy,

I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this 
weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying
the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't 
mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade.  
Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.
